MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

     Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as defined by SEC rules adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. It consists of
policies and procedures that:




 

 
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;


 

 

 
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of our management and directors; and


 

 

 
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.



     Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), we made an assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, we
used the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, we
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been
audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
El Paso Corporation:


     We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of El Paso Corporation as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. The financial statements of Citrus Corp. and
Subsidiaries (a corporation in which the Company had a 50% interest as of December 31, 2007 and 2006) and Four Star Oil
& Gas Company (a corporation in which the Company had
approximately a 49% and 43% interest, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively) have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, insofar as it relates to the amounts included from Citrus Corp. and Subsidiaries
and Four Star Oil & Gas Company, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors. In the consolidated financial
statements, the Companys combined investments in these companies represent approximately 3% of total assets
as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and earnings from these investments
represent approximately 23% and
24% of income before income taxes from continuing operations for the years then ended, based on the amounts audited
by other auditors.

     We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the reports of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.



     In our opinion, based on
our audits and the reports of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of El Paso Corporation at December 31,
2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.


     As discussed in Note 1
to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
the provisions of  Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, effective December 31, 2006 the Company adopted
the recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106,
and 132(R), and effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123(revised 2004), Share-Based Payment and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commissions accounting release related to pipeline assessment costs.


     We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), El Paso Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based
on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2008 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
El Paso Corporation:


     We have audited El Paso
Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based
on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). El Paso Corporations management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


     We conducted our audit in
 accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


     A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


     Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.


     In our opinion, El Paso Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.


     We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the 2007 consolidated financial statements of El Paso Corporation and our report dated February 25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
El Paso Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders
equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005 present fairly, in all material
respects, the results of operations and cash flows of El Paso Corporation and its
subsidiaries (the Company) for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule for the year ended December 31, 2005 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule
based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, on December
31, 2005.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders of Four Star Oil & Gas Company:

     In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows (not presented
separately herein) present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Four Star Oil & Gas Company (the Company) and
its subsidiary at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     As described in Notes 3 and 4 to the financial statements, the Company has significant
transactions with affiliated companies. Because of these relationships, it is possible that the
terms of these transactions are not the same as those that would result from transactions among
wholly unrelated parties.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

     Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

     Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of all majority owned and controlled
subsidiaries after the elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Our
financial statements for prior periods include reclassifications that were made to conform to the
current year presentation. These reclassifications did not impact our reported net income (loss) or
stockholders equity.

     We consolidate entities when we either (i) have the ability to control the operating and
financial decisions and policies of that entity or (ii) are allocated a majority of the entitys
losses and/or returns through our variable interests (see Note 17) in that entity. The
determination of our ability to control or exert significant influence over an entity and whether
we are allocated a majority of the entitys losses and/or returns involves the use of judgment. We
apply the equity method of accounting where we can exert significant influence over, but do not
control, the policies and decisions of an entity and where we are not allocated a majority of the
entitys losses and/or returns. We use the cost method of accounting where we are unable to exert
significant influence over the entity.

     Use of Estimates

     The preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts we report as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and our disclosures in
these financial statements. Actual results can, and often do, differ from those estimates.

     Regulated Operations

     Our interstate natural gas pipelines and storage operations are subject to the jurisdiction of
the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and the Energy
Policy Act of 2005. Our pipelines follow the regulatory accounting principles prescribed under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation. Under SFAS No. 71, we record regulatory assets and liabilities that would not
be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent
probable future revenues or expenses associated with certain charges or credits that will be
recovered from or refunded to customers through the rate making process. Items to which we apply
regulatory accounting requirements include certain postretirement employee benefit plan costs, an
equity return component on regulated capital projects and certain costs
included in, or expected to be included in, future rates.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents

     We consider short-term investments with an original maturity of less than three months to be
cash equivalents.

     We maintain cash on deposit with banks and insurance companies that is pledged for a
particular use or restricted to support a potential liability. We classify these balances as
restricted cash in other current or non-current assets on our balance sheet based on when we expect
the restrictions on this cash to be removed. As of December 31, 2007, we had $7 million of
restricted cash in current assets and $91 million in other non-current assets. As of December 31,
2006, we had $8 million of restricted cash in other current assets and $123 million in other
non-current assets.

     Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

     We establish provisions for losses on accounts and notes receivable and for natural gas
imbalances due from shippers and operators if we determine that we will not collect all or part of
the outstanding balance. We regularly review collectibility and establish or adjust our allowance
as necessary using the specific identification method.

Table of Contents

     Inventory

     Our
inventory consists primarily of supplies and materials and is
classified as current on our balance sheet. We use the average cost
method to account for our inventories. We value all inventory at the
lower of its cost or market value.
     Property, Plant and Equipment

     Pipelines and Other (Excluding Natural Gas and Oil Properties). Our property, plant and
equipment is recorded at its original cost of construction or, upon acquisition, at the fair value
of the assets acquired. For assets we construct, we capitalize direct costs, such as labor and
materials, and indirect costs, such as overhead, interest and, an equity return component in our
regulated businesses. We capitalize major units of property replacements or improvements and
expense minor items. Prior to January 1, 2006, we capitalized certain costs our interstate
pipelines incurred related to their pipeline integrity programs as part of our property, plant and
equipment. Beginning January 1, 2006, we began expensing these costs based on FERC guidance. During
the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we expensed
approximately $18 million and $19 million as
a result of the adoption of this accounting release, which was
approximately $0.03 per basic and fully diluted share in 2007 and $0.02 per
basic and fully diluted share in 2006.

     Included in our pipeline property balances are additional acquisition costs, which represent
the excess purchase costs associated with purchase business combinations allocated to our regulated
interstate systems property, plant and equipment. These costs are amortized on a straight-line
basis and we do not recover these excess costs in our rates.

     When we retire property, plant and equipment in our regulated operations, we charge
accumulated depreciation and amortization for the original cost of the assets in addition to the
cost to remove, sell or dispose of the assets, less their salvage value. We do not recognize a gain
or loss unless we sell an entire operating unit. We include gains or losses on dispositions of
operating units in operating income.

     Natural Gas and Oil Properties. We use the full cost method to account for our natural gas
and oil properties. Under the full cost method, substantially all costs incurred in connection with
the acquisition, development and exploration of natural gas and oil reserves are capitalized on a
country-by-country basis. These capitalized amounts include the costs of unproved properties,
internal costs directly related to acquisition, development and exploration activities, asset
retirement costs and capitalized interest. Under the full cost method, both dry hole costs and
geological and geophysical costs are capitalized into the full cost pool, which is subject to
amortization and periodically assessed for impairment through a ceiling test calculation discussed
below.

     Capitalized costs associated with proved reserves are amortized over the life of the reserves
using the unit of production method. Conversely, capitalized costs associated with unproved
properties are excluded from the amortizable base until these properties are evaluated, which
occurs quarterly. We transfer unproved property costs into the amortizable base when properties are
determined to have proved reserves. In addition, in areas where a natural gas or oil reserve base
exists, we transfer unproved property costs to the amortizable base when unproved properties are
evaluated as being impaired and as exploratory dry holes are determined to be unsuccessful.
Additionally, the amortizable base includes future development costs; dismantlement, restoration
and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values; and geological and geophysical costs
incurred that cannot be associated with specific unevaluated properties or prospects in which we
own a direct interest.

     Our capitalized costs, net of related income tax effects, are limited to a ceiling based on
the present value of future net revenues discounted at 10 percent plus the lower of cost or fair
market value of unproved properties, net of related income tax effects. We utilize end-of-period
spot prices when calculating future net revenues unless those prices result in a ceiling test
charge in which case we evaluate price recoveries subsequent to the end of the period. If total
capitalized costs exceed the ceiling, we are required to write-down our capitalized costs to the
ceiling. We perform this ceiling test calculation each quarter. Any required write-down is included
in our income statement as a ceiling test charge. Our ceiling test calculations include the effects
of derivative instruments we have designated as, and that qualify as, cash flow hedges of our
anticipated future natural gas and oil production. Our ceiling test calculations exclude the
estimated future cash outflows associated with asset retirement liabilities related to proved
developed reserves.

     When we sell or convey interests in our natural gas and oil properties, we reduce our natural
gas and oil reserves for the amount attributable to the sold or conveyed interest. We do not
recognize a gain or loss on sales of our natural gas and oil properties, unless those sales would
significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. We treat sales
proceeds on non-significant sales as an adjustment to the cost of our properties.

     Asset and Investment Divestitures/Impairments

     We evaluate assets and investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that
their carrying values may not be recovered. These events include market declines that are believed
to be other than temporary, changes in the manner in which we intend to use a long-lived asset,
decisions to sell an asset or investment and adverse changes in the legal or business environment
such

93

Table of Contents

as adverse actions by regulators. When an event occurs, we evaluate the recoverability of our
carrying value based on either (i) the long-lived assets ability to generate future cash flows on
an undiscounted basis or (ii) the fair value of the investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. If
an impairment is indicated, or if we decide to sell a long-lived asset or group of assets, we
adjust the carrying values of the asset downward, if necessary, to their estimated fair value. Our
fair value estimates are generally based on market data obtained through the sales process or an
analysis of expected discounted cash flows. The magnitude of any impairment is impacted by a number
of factors, including the nature of the assets being sold and our established time frame for
completing the sale, among other factors.

     We reclassify the asset or assets to be sold as either held-for-sale or as discontinued
operations, depending on, among other criteria, whether we will have significant long-term
continuing involvement with those assets after they are sold. We cease depreciating assets in the
period that they are reclassified as either held for sale or discontinued operations.

     Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

     We
maintain several pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans require us to
make contributions to fund the benefits to be paid out under the plans. These contributions are
invested until the benefits are paid out to plan participants. We record benefit expense related to
these plans in our income statement. This benefit expense is a function of many factors including
benefits earned during the year by plan participants (which is a function of the employees salary,
the level of benefits provided under the plan, actuarial assumptions, and the passage of time),
expected returns on plan assets and amortization of certain deferred gains and losses. For a
further discussion of our policies with respect to our pension and postretirement plans, see Note
13.

     Our pension and other postretirement benefit plans use the recognition provisions of SFAS No.
158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an
Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). Under SFAS No. 158, we record an asset or
liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or
underfunded status. Any deferred amounts related to unrealized gains and losses or changes in
actuarial assumptions are recorded either as a regulatory asset or liability for our regulated
operations or in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders
equity, for our nonregulated operations until those gains and losses are recognized in the income
statement. For a further discussion of our application of SFAS No. 158, see Note 13.

     Revenue Recognition

     Our business segments provide a number of services and sell a variety of products. We record
revenues for these products and services which include estimates of amounts earned but unbilled. We
estimate these unbilled revenues related to services provided or products delivered based on
contract data, regulatory information, commodity prices, and preliminary throughput and allocation
measurements, among other items. The revenue recognition policies of our most significant operating
segments are as follows:

     Pipelines revenues. Our Pipelines segment derives revenues primarily from transportation and
storage services. Revenues for all services are generally based on the thermal quantity of gas
delivered or subscribed at a price specified in the contract. For our transportation and storage
services, we recognize reservation revenues on firm contracted capacity ratably over the contract
period regardless of the amount of natural gas that is transported or stored. For interruptible or
volumetric based services, we record revenues when physical deliveries of natural gas are made at
the agreed upon delivery point or when gas is injected or withdrawn from the storage facility. Gas
not needed for operations is based on the volumes we are allowed to retain relative to the amounts
of gas we use for operating purposes. We recognize revenue from gas not used in operations when we
retain the volumes under our tariffs. We are subject to FERC regulations and, as a result, revenues
we collect in rate proceedings may be subject to refund. We establish reserves for these potential
refunds.

     Exploration and Production revenues. Our Exploration and Production segment derives revenues
primarily through the physical sale of natural gas, oil, condensate and NGL. Revenues from sales of
these products are recorded upon delivery and passage of title using the sales method, net of any
royalty interests or other profit interests in the produced product. When actual natural gas sales
volumes exceed our entitled share of sales volumes, an overproduced imbalance occurs. To the extent
the overproduced imbalance exceeds our share of the remaining estimated proved natural gas reserves
for a given property, we record a liability. Costs associated with the transportation and delivery
of production are included in cost of products and services.

94

Table of Contents

     Marketing revenues. Our Marketing segment derives revenues from physical natural gas and
power transactions and the management of derivative contracts. Our derivative transactions are
recorded at their fair value and changes in their fair value are reflected net in operating
revenues. For a further discussion of our income recognition policies on derivatives see Price Risk
Management Activities below. The impact of non-derivative transactions, including our
transportation contracts, are recognized net in operating revenues based on the contractual or
market price and related volumes at the time the commodity is delivered or the contracts are
terminated.

     Environmental Costs and Other Contingencies

     Environmental Costs. We record liabilities at their undiscounted amounts on our balance sheet
as other current and long-term liabilities when environmental assessments indicate that remediation
efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of our liabilities are
based on currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations
taking into consideration the likely effects of other societal and economic factors, and include
estimates of associated legal costs. These amounts also consider prior experience in remediating
contaminated sites, other companies clean-up experience and data released by the EPA or other
organizations. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new
circumstances. We capitalize costs that benefit future periods and recognize a current period
charge in operation and maintenance expense when clean-up efforts do not benefit future periods.

     We evaluate any amounts paid directly or reimbursed by government sponsored programs and
potential recoveries or reimbursements of remediation costs from third parties, including insurance
coverage, separately from our liability. Recovery is evaluated based on the creditworthiness or
solvency of the third party, among other factors. When recovery is assured, we record and report an
asset separately from the associated liability on our balance sheet.

     Other Contingencies. We recognize liabilities for other contingencies when we have an
exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Where the most likely outcome of a
contingency can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for that amount. Where the most
likely outcome cannot be estimated, a range of potential losses is established and if no one amount
in that range is more likely than any other, the low end of the range is accrued.

     Price Risk Management Activities

     Our price risk management activities consist of the following activities:




 

 
derivatives entered into to hedge or otherwise reduce the commodity exposure on our
natural gas and oil production and interest rate and foreign currency exposure on our
long-term debt; and


 

 

 
derivatives not intended to hedge these exposures, including those related to our legacy
trading activities that we entered into with the objective of generating profits from
exposure to shifts or changes in market prices.



     Our derivatives are reflected on our balance sheet at their fair value as assets and
liabilities from price risk management activities. We classify our derivatives as either current or
non-current assets or liabilities based on their anticipated settlement date. We net derivative
assets and liabilities for counterparties where we have a legal right of offset. See Note 7 for a
further discussion of our price risk management activities. During
2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Staff Position (FSP) FIN
No. 39-1, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
Contracts, which allowed companies the option to offset amounts
recorded for their derivative contracts with cash collateral posted
or held if the contracts are executed with the same counterparty and
under the same master netting arrangement. We elected to continue to
report separately amounts recorded for derivative contracts from cash
collateral posted or held on our balance sheet and, as a result, our
adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial statements.

     Derivatives that we have designated as accounting hedges impact our revenues or expenses based
on the nature and timing of the transactions that they hedge. Derivatives that we have not
designated as hedges are marked-to-market each period and changes in their fair value are reflected
as revenues.

     In our cash flow statement, cash inflows and outflows associated with the settlement of our
derivative instruments are recognized in operating cash flows (other than those derivatives
intended to hedge the principal amounts of our foreign currency denominated debt). In our balance
sheet, receivables and payables resulting from the settlement of our derivative instruments are
reported as trade receivables and payables.

95

Table of Contents

     Income Taxes

     We record current income taxes based on our current taxable income and provide for deferred
income taxes to reflect estimated future tax payments and receipts. Deferred taxes represent the
tax impacts of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities
and carryovers at each year end. We account for tax credits under the flow-through method, which
reduces the provision for income taxes in the year the tax credits first become available. We
reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance when, based on our estimates, it is more likely
than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates
utilized in recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision, either up or down, in
future periods based on new facts or circumstances.

     Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 clarifies SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and requires us
to evaluate our tax positions for all jurisdictions and for all years where the statute of
limitations has not expired. FIN No. 48 requires companies to meet a more-likely-than-not
threshold (i.e. greater than a 50 percent likelihood of a tax position being sustained under
examination) prior to recording a benefit for their tax positions. Additionally, for tax positions
meeting this more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount of benefit is limited to the largest
benefit that has a greater than 50 percent probability of being realized upon effective settlement.


We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
expenses on our income statement.

For a further discussion of the impact of the adoption of FIN No. 48, see Note 4.

     Foreign Currency Translation

     For foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency, assets and liabilities
are translated at year-end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average
exchange rates prevailing during the year. The cumulative effects of translating the local currency
to the U.S. dollar are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) in stockholders equity on our balance sheet.

     Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

     We account for our asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation
(FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. We record a liability for
legal obligations associated with the replacement, removal, or retirement of our long-lived assets.
Our asset retirement liabilities  are recorded at their estimated
fair value with a corresponding increase to property, plant and equipment. This increase in
property, plant and equipment is then depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset to
which that liability relates. An ongoing expense is also recognized for changes in the value of the
liability as a result of the passage of time, which we record as depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense in our income statement. Our regulated pipelines have the ability to recover
certain of these costs from their customers and have recorded an asset (rather than expense)
associated with the depreciation of the property, plant and equipment and accretion of the
liabilities described above.

     Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

     On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, prospectively for awards
of stock-based compensation granted after that date and for the unvested portion of outstanding
awards at that date. We measure all employee stock-based compensation awards at fair value on the
date they are granted to employees and recognize compensation cost in our financial statements over
the requisite service period. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based compensation
awards using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations, and did
not record compensation expense on stock options that were granted at the market value of the stock
on the date of grant.  For additional information on our stock-based compensation awards, see
Note 15.

     New Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted

     As of December 31, 2007, the following accounting standards and interpretations had not yet
been adopted by us.

     Fair Value Measurements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements, which provides guidance on measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements. We will adopt the provisions of this standard for our financial assets and
liabilities effective January 1, 2008, at which time we will be required to consider our own credit
standing in the determination of the fair value of our liabilities. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material
impact on our financial statements. The FASB provided a one year deferral of the adoption of SFAS
No. 157 for certain non-financial assets and liabilities. We have elected to defer the adoption for
certain of our non-financial assets and liabilities and are currently evaluating the impact, if
any, that the deferred provisions of this standard will have on our financial statements.

     Measurement Date of Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. In December 2006, we adopted
the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158. Beginning in 2008, this standard will also require us
to change the measurement date of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans from September
30, the date we currently use, to December 31. Adoption of the measurement date
provisions of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

     Fair Value Option. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  including an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, which permits entities to choose
to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We will adopt the
provisions of this standard effective January 1, 2008, and do
not anticipate that it will have
a material impact on our financial statements.

     Business Combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business
Combinations, which provides revised guidance on the accounting for acquisitions of businesses.
This standard changes the
current guidance to require that all acquired assets, liabilities,
minority interest and certain contingencies be measured at fair
value, and certain other acquisition-related costs be expensed rather than capitalized. SFAS No.
141(R) will apply to acquisitions that are effective after December 31, 2008, and application of
the standard to acquisitions prior to that date is not permitted.

     Noncontrolling Interests. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, which provides guidance on the presentation of
minority interest in the financial statements. This standard requires that minority interest be
presented as a separate component of equity rather than as a mezzanine item between liabilities
and equity, and also requires that minority interest be presented as a separate caption in the
income statement. This standard also requires all transactions with minority interest holders,
including the issuance and repurchase of minority interests, be accounted for as equity
transactions unless a change in control of the subsidiary occurs. SFAS No. 160 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and we are currently evaluating the impact that
this standard will have on our financial statements.

2. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

     Peoples
Energy Production Company (Peoples). In September 2007, we acquired Peoples for $887
million using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. Peoples is an
exploration and production company with natural gas and oil properties located primarily in the
Arklatex, Texas Gulf Coast and Mississippi areas and in the San Juan and Arkoma Basins.
We accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and allocated the
purchase price primarily to natural gas and oil properties on our balance sheet, which is subject
to change based on the finalization of this allocation. We did not record any goodwill
associated with this transaction.

     South Texas properties. In January 2007, we acquired operated natural gas and oil producing
properties and undeveloped acreage in south Texas, for approximately $254 million.

     Medicine Bow. In August 2005, we completed the acquisition of Medicine Bow, a privately
held energy company, for total cash consideration of approximately $853 million. As part of the
transaction, we also acquired Four Star, an unconsolidated affiliate of Medicine Bow, and we
reflect our proportionate share of their operating results as earnings from unconsolidated
affiliates in our financial statements (see Note 17). In 2007, we increased our ownership in
Four Star from 43 percent to 49 percent.

     Gulf LNG. In February 2008, we closed on the previously announced acquisition of a 50
percent interest in the Gulf LNG Clean Energy Project, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal
which is currently under construction in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and
paid $294 million.

     Divestitures

     During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we sold a number of assets and investments in each of our business
segments and corporate activities. The table and discussions below summarize the assets sold and
proceeds from these sales:

Proceeds exclude any returns of capital on our
investments in unconsolidated affiliates and cash
transferred with the assets sold and include costs
incurred in preparing assets for disposal. These items
increased our sales proceeds by $40 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007, increased our sales proceeds by
$15 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and
decreased our sales proceeds by $35 million for the years
ended December 31, 2005.


     Power. Assets sold in 2006 consisted primarily of our interests in MCV and power plants in
Brazil, Asia, and Central America. Assets sold in 2005 consisted primarily of interests in our
power contract restructuring entities and power plants in India and Korea.

     Field Services. Assets sold in 2005 consisted primarily of our investment in Enterprise and
the Javelina natural gas processing and pipeline assets.

98

Table of Contents

     Exploration and Production, Marketing, Pipelines and Corporate. Assets sold consisted
primarily of our investment in NYMEX and our Stagecoach Pipeline lateral in 2007, natural gas and
oil properties in south Texas in 2006 and pipeline facilities and gathering systems located in the
southeastern and western U.S. and Lakeside Technology Center in 2005.

     Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale

     Under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we
classify assets to be disposed of as held for sale or, if appropriate, discontinued operations when
they have received appropriate approvals to be disposed of by our management or Board of Directors
and when they meet other criteria. Cash flows from our discontinued businesses are reflected as
discontinued operating, investing, and financing activities in our statement of cash flows. To the
extent these operations do not maintain separate cash balances, we reflect the net cash flows
generated from these businesses as a contribution to our continuing operations in cash from
continuing financing activities. The following is a description of our discontinued operations and
summarized results of these operations for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. We
also had $28 million of assets held for sale as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, all
of our assets and liabilities related to our discontinued operations and assets held for sale had
been sold.

     ANR and Related Operations. In February 2007, we sold ANR, our Michigan storage assets and
our 50 percent interest in Great Lakes Gas Transmission for approximately $3.7 billion. We recorded
a gain on the sale of $648 million, net of taxes of $354 million. Included in the net assets of
these discontinued operations as of the date of sale were net deferred tax liabilities assumed by
the purchaser. We also recorded approximately $188 million of deferred taxes in 2006 in
conjunction with the sale.

     International Power Operations. During 2006, we completed the sale of all of our discontinued
international power operations including Macae, a wholly owned power plant facility in Brazil, and
Asian and Central American power assets for total net proceeds of approximately $368 million.
Previously in 2005, we recognized approximately $499 million of impairments, net of minority
interest, based upon indications of the value we would receive upon the sale of the assets.

     South Louisiana Gathering and Processing Operations. During 2005, we completed the sale of
our south Louisiana gathering and processing assets for net proceeds of approximately $486 million
and recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $394 million. These assets were part of our
historical Field Services segment.

     Other.
Prior to 2005, our Canadian and certain other international natural gas and oil
production operations and our petroleum markets businesses and
operations were approved for sale. We completed the sale of substantially all of these
properties in 2004 and 2005.

     Income Taxes on Discontinued Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, we incurred income tax expense associated with our discontinued operations of $369 million,
$274 million and $179 million resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 35%, 126% and
216% for these years. The effective tax rates in 2006 and 2005 are significantly higher than the
statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:




 

 
In 2006, we recorded approximately $188 million of deferred taxes upon agreeing to sell
the stock of ANR, our Michigan storage assets and our 50 percent interest in Great Lakes Gas
Transmission. Prior to our decision to sell, we only recorded deferred taxes on individual
assets/liabilities and a portion of our investment in the stock of one of these companies;

     In 2006 and 2005, our overall effective tax rate on continuing operations was significantly
different than the statutory rate due primarily to the conclusion of IRS audits. In 2006, our audit
settlements primarily relate to the conclusion of the audits of The Coastal Corporations 1998-2000
tax years and El Pasos 2001 and 2002 tax years which resulted in the reduction of tax
contingencies and the reinstatement of certain tax credits. In 2005, audit settlements primarily
relate to the conclusion of The Coastal Corporations IRS tax audits for years prior to 1998.

     We expect to receive sales proceeds within the U.S. on Asia and Central America power assets and
have recorded U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities on book versus tax basis differences in
these assets. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we have U.S. deferred tax assets of $12 million and
$45 million and U.S. deferred tax liabilities of $1 million and $2 million related to these
investments. Cumulative undistributed earnings from substantially all of the remainder of our
foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures (excluding the power assets discussed
above) have been or are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Therefore, no
provision has been made for any U.S. taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may be applicable upon
actual or deemed repatriation, and an estimate of the taxes if earnings were to be repatriated is
not practical. At December 31, 2007, the portion of the cumulative undistributed earnings from
these investments on which we have not recorded U.S. income taxes was approximately $117 million.
For these same reasons, we have not recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes on the foreign
currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Table of Contents

     Unrecognized Tax Benefits (Liabilities) for Uncertain Tax Matters (FIN No. 48). We file
income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions.
With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income
tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 1999. Additionally, the Internal Revenue
Service has completed an examination of El Pasos U. S. income tax returns for 2003 and 2004, with
a tentative settlement at the appellate level for all issues. While the settlement of these
matters is expected to change our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months, we do not
anticipate the impact to be significant to our results of operations, financial condition or
liquidity. For our remaining open tax years, our unrecognized tax benefits (liabilities for
uncertain tax matters) could increase or decrease our income tax expense and effective income tax
rates as these matters are finalized, although we are currently unable to estimate the range of
potential impacts these matters could have on our financial statements.

     Upon the adoption of FIN No. 48, we recorded additional liabilities for unrecognized tax
benefits of $2 million, including interest and penalties, which we accounted for as an increase of
$4 million to our January 1, 2007 accumulated deficit and an increase of $2 million to additional
paidin capital. The following table below shows the change in unrecognized tax benefits from
January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007:

Balance at January 1, 2007 including $39 million of interest and
penalties was $178 million.

There were no lapses in statutes of limitations during 2007 that impacted
our unrecognized tax benefits.


     As
of December 31, 2007,  approximately $132 million (net of federal tax benefits) of unrecognized tax
benefits would affect our income tax expense and our effective income tax rate if recognized in
future periods. While the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve
months, we do not expect this change to have a significant impact on our results of operations or
financial position.

     During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $6
million in interest and penalties. We had $45 million accrued for the payment of interest and
penalties as of December 31, 2007.

     Tax Credit and NOL Carryovers. As of December 31, 2007, we have U.S. federal alternative
minimum tax credits of $344 million that carryover indefinitely. The
table below presents the details of our federal and state net operating loss carryover periods as
of December 31, 2007:

     We also had $240 million of foreign net operating loss carryovers and $68 million of foreign
capital loss carryovers which carryover indefinitely. Usage of our U.S. federal carryovers is
subject to the limitations provided under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code as well
as the separate return limitation year rules of IRS regulations.

     Valuation Allowances. Deferred tax assets are recorded on net operating losses and temporary
differences in the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities expected to produce tax deductions
in future periods. The realization of these assets depends on recognition of sufficient future
taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions during periods in which those temporary differences or
net operating losses are deductible. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance on our
deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
them will not be realized. As part of our assessment, we consider future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, primarily related to depreciation. We believe it is more likely than
not that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation
allowances.

     We exclude potentially dilutive securities from the determination of diluted earnings per
share (as well as their related income statement impacts) when their impact on income from
continuing operations per common share is antidilutive. These potentially dilutive securities
consist of our employee stock options, restricted stock, convertible preferred stock, trust
preferred securities, and zero coupon convertible debentures (which were paid off in April 2006).
For the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, certain employee stock options and our trust
preferred securities were antidilutive. Additionally, in 2006, our zero coupon convertible
debentures (redeemed in April 2006) were antidilutive and in 2007 our convertible preferred stock
was antidilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we incurred losses from continuing
operations and accordingly excluded all potentially dilutive securities from the determination of
diluted earnings per share as their impact on loss per common share was antidilutive. For a
discussion of our capital stock activity, our stock-based compensation arrangements, and other
instruments noted above, see Notes 14 and 15.

     As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term borrowings, and trade receivables and payables represented fair value because of the
short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates its carrying
value because of the market-based nature of the interest rate. We estimated the fair value of debt
with fixed interest rates based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. See Note 7
for a discussion of our methodology of determining the fair value of the derivative instruments
used in our price risk management activities. Our investments primarily relate to available for
sale securities and cost basis investments.




7. Price Risk Management Activities

     The following table summarizes the carrying value of the derivatives used in our price risk
management activities as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. In the table, derivatives designated as
hedges consist of instruments used to hedge our natural gas and oil production. Other
commodity-based derivative contracts relate to derivative contracts not designated as hedges, such
as options and swaps, other natural gas and power purchase and supply contracts, and derivatives
from our historical energy trading activities. Finally, interest rate and foreign currency
derivatives consist of swaps that are primarily designated as hedges of our interest rate and
foreign currency risk on long-term debt.

     Our derivative contracts are recorded in our financial statements at fair value. The best
indication of fair value is quoted market prices. However, when quoted market prices are not
available, we estimate the fair value of those derivatives. We use commodity pricing data either
obtained or derived from an independent pricing source and other assumptions about certain power
and natural gas markets to develop price curves. The curves are then used to estimate the value of
settlements in future periods based on the contractual settlement quantities and dates. Finally, we
discount these estimated settlement values using a LIBOR curve. We record valuation adjustments to
reflect uncertainties associated with the estimates we use in determining fair value. Common
valuation adjustments include those for market liquidity and those for the credit-worthiness of our
contractual counterparties. We believe this methodology results in a fair value that is representative
of the proceeds we would receive if we disposed of our derivative
instruments. The estimates utilized in determining the fair value of derivatives are subject to
revisions, either up or down, in future periods based on changes in market conditions. During
2006, we changed the independent pricing source that provided the pricing data we used in valuing
certain of our commodity-based derivative contracts. These changes did not have a material impact
on the fair value of our positions.

Derivatives Designated as Hedges

     We engage in two types of hedging activities: hedges of cash flow exposure and hedges of fair
value exposure. When we enter into a derivative contract, we may designate the derivative as either
a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge, at which time we prepare the documentation required under
SFAS No. 133. Hedges of cash flow exposure, which primarily relate to our natural gas and oil
production hedges and interest rate risks on our long-term debt, are designed to hedge forecasted
sales transactions or limit the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
recognized asset or liability. Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into to protect the fair
value of a recognized asset, liability or firm commitment. Hedges of our interest rate and foreign
currency exposure are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges based on whether
the interest on the underlying debt is converted to either a fixed or floating interest rate.
Changes in derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in
accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to the extent that they are effective and then
recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
that are designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in
fair values of the related hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments. The ineffective portion
of a hedges change in fair value, if any, is recognized immediately in earnings as a component of
operating revenues or interest and debt expense in our income statement. A discussion of each of
our hedging activities is as follows:

     Cash Flow Hedges. A majority of our commodity sales and purchases are at spot market or
forward market prices. We use fixed price swaps and floor and ceiling option contracts to limit our
exposure to decreases in commodity prices as well as fluctuations in foreign currency and
interest rates with the objective of limiting the variability of the cash flows from these
activities. A summary of the impacts of our cash flow hedges included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 follows:

Reclassifications occur upon the physical delivery of the hedged commodity or if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable.


     For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized a net loss of $3 million,
a net gain of $10 million and a net loss of $5 million, net of income taxes, respectively, in our
income (loss) from continuing operations related to the ineffective portion of our cash flow
hedges.

     Fair Value Hedges. We have fixed rate U.S. dollar and foreign currency denominated debt that
exposes us to paying higher than market rates should interest rates decline. We use interest rate
swaps to protect the value of these debt instruments by converting the fixed amounts of interest
due under the debt agreements to variable interest payments and have recorded the fair value of
these derivatives as a component of long-term debt and the related accrued interest. As of December
31, 2007 and 2006, these derivatives were as follows (amounts in millions):

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, these derivatives, when combined with our Euro denominated
debt, converted 330 million Euro and 350 million Euro of our debt to $379 million and $402
million.


     Other Commodity-Based Derivatives.

     Our other commodity-based derivatives primarily relate to derivative contracts not designated
as hedges and other contracts associated with our legacy trading activities.

     Credit Risk

     We are subject to credit risk related to our financial instrument assets. Credit risk relates
to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties pursuant
to the terms of their contractual obligations. We measure credit risk as the estimated replacement
costs for commodities we would have to purchase or sell in the future, plus amounts owed from
counterparties for delivered and unpaid commodities. These exposures are netted where we have a
legally enforceable right of setoff. We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties
in our price risk management activities to minimize overall credit risk. These policies

Table of Contents

require (i) the evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition (including credit
rating), (ii) collateral under certain circumstances (including cash in advance, letters of credit,
and guarantees), (iii) the use of margining provisions in standard contracts, and (iv) the use of
master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various
contracts associated with a single counterparty.

     We use daily margining provisions in our financial contracts, most of our physical power
agreements and our master netting agreements, which require a counterparty to post cash or letters
of credit when the fair value of the contract exceeds the daily contractual threshold. The
threshold amount is typically tied to the published credit rating of the counterparty. Our
margining collateral provisions also allow us to terminate a contract and liquidate all positions
if the counterparty is unable to provide the required collateral. Under our margining provisions,
we are required to return collateral if the amount of posted collateral exceeds the amount of
collateral required. Collateral received or returned can vary significantly from day to day based
on the changes in the market values and our counterpartys credit ratings. Furthermore, the amount
of collateral we hold may be more or less than the fair value of our derivative contracts with that
counterparty at any given period. The following table presents a summary of the fair value of our
derivative contracts, net of collateral and liabilities where a right of offset exists. It is
presented by type of derivative counterparty in which we had net asset exposure as of December 31,
2007 and 2006:

Investment Grade and Below Investment Grade are
determined using publicly available credit ratings.
Investment Grade includes counterparties with a minimum
Standard & Poors rating of BBB  or Moodys rating of
Baa3. Below Investment Grade includes counterparties
with a public credit rating that do not meet the criteria
of Investment Grade. Not Rated includes counterparties
that are not rated by any public rating service.


     We have approximately 48 counterparties as of December 31, 2007. If one of our counterparties
fails to perform, we may recognize an immediate loss in our earnings, as well as additional
financial impacts in the future delivery periods to the extent a replacement contract at the same
prices and quantities cannot be established.

     As of December 31, 2007, four counterparties, (Merrill Lynch Commodities, Morgan Stanley
Group, Central Lomas de Real and Constellation Energy Commodities
Group, Inc.) comprise 20 percent, 16 percent,
15 percent and 12 percent, respectively of our net financial asset exposure. As of December 31,
2006, three counterparties (Deutsche Bank AG, J. Aron & Company and Constellation Energy
Commodities Group, Inc.) comprised 39 percent, 18 percent and 16 percent of our net financial
instrument asset exposure. The concentration of counterparties may impact our overall exposure to
credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be similarly affected
by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.

(1)
 
Under the composite (group) method, assets with
similar useful lives and other characteristics are grouped
and depreciated as one asset. We apply the depreciation
rate approved in our rate settlements to the total cost of
the group until its net book value equals its salvage
value. We re-evaluate depreciation rates each time we
redevelop our transportation rates when we file with the
FERC for an increase or decrease in rates. 

 

(2)
 
Capitalized costs associated with proved reserves are
amortized over the life of the reserves using the unit of
production method. Conversely, capitalized costs
associated with unproved properties are excluded from the
amortizable base until these properties are evaluated. See
Note 1 for additional information.


     Excess purchase costs. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, TGP and EPNG have excess purchase
costs associated with their historical acquisition. Total excess costs on these pipelines were
approximately $2.5 billion and accumulated depreciation was approximately $0.4 billion at December
31, 2007 and 2006. These excess costs are being depreciated over the life of the pipeline assets to
which the costs were assigned, and our related depreciation expense for each year ended December
31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was approximately $42 million. We do not currently earn a return on these
excess purchase costs from our rate payers.

     Capitalized costs during construction. We capitalize a carrying cost on funds related to our
construction of long-lived assets and reflect these as increases in the cost of the asset on our
balance sheet. This carrying cost consists of (i) an interest cost on our debt that could be
attributed to the assets being constructed, and (ii) in our regulated transmission business, a
return on our equity, that could be attributed to the assets being constructed. The debt portion is
calculated based on the average cost of debt. Interest costs capitalized are included as a
reduction of interest expense in our income statements and were $50 million, $41 million and $41
million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The equity portion is calculated
using the most recent FERC approved equity rate of return. Equity amounts capitalized are included
as other non-operating income on our income statement and were $32 million, $20 million and $23
million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Table of Contents

     Construction
work-in progress. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had
approximately $1.6
billion and $1 billion of construction work-in-progress included in our property, plant and
equipment.

     Asset retirement obligations. We have legal obligations associated with the retirement of our
natural gas and oil wells and related infrastructure, natural gas pipelines, transmission
facilities and storage wells, and obligations related to our corporate headquarters building. In
our production operations, we have obligations to plug wells when abandoned because production is
exhausted or we no longer plan to use the wells. In our pipeline operations, our legal obligations
primarily involve purging and sealing the pipelines if they are abandoned. We also have obligations
to remove hazardous materials associated with our natural gas transmission facilities and in our
corporate headquarters if these facilities are ever demolished, replaced or renovated. We continue
to evaluate our asset retirement obligations and future developments could impact the amounts we
record.

     Where we can reasonably estimate the asset retirement obligation liability, we accrue a
liability based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement In estimating the fair
value of the liabilities associated with our asset retirement obligations, we utilize several
assumptions, including a projected inflation rate of 2.5 percent, and credit-adjusted discount
rates that currently range from six to eight percent. We record changes in these estimates based on
the expected amount and timing of payments to settle our asset retirement obligations. Typically,
these changes result from obtaining new information in our Exploration and Production segment about
the timing of our obligations to plug our natural gas and oil wells and the costs to do so. In
2006, we also revised our estimates due primarily to the impacts of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In
our pipelines operations, we intend on operating and maintaining our natural gas pipeline and
storage systems as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which we expect for the
foreseeable future. Therefore, we believe that we cannot reasonably estimate the asset retirement
obligation liability for the substantial majority of our natural gas pipeline and storage system
assets because these assets have indeterminate lives.

     The net asset retirement liability as of December 31 reported on our balance sheet in other
current and non-current liabilities, and the changes in the net liability for the years ended
December 31, were as follows:

     During 2007, we recorded $291 million of pre-tax losses on the extinguishment of certain debt
obligations repurchased and debt refinanced above.

     Prior to their redemption in 2006, we recorded accretion expense on our zero coupon
debentures, which increased the principal balance of long-term debt each period. During 2006 and
2005, the accretion recorded in interest expense was $4 million and $25 million. During 2006 and
2005, we redeemed $615 million and $236 million of our zero coupon convertible debentures, of which
$110 million and $34 million represented increased principal due to the accretion of interest on
the debentures. We account for these redemptions as financing activities in our statement of cash
flows.

     Credit Facilities/Letters of Credit

     As of December 31, 2007, subject to the terms of various agreements, we had available capacity
under such credit agreements of approximately $1.0 billion,
exclusive of capacity on the El Paso Pipeline Partners, L.P. (EPPP) facility further discussed below. Below is a description of our existing credit facilities as of
December 31, 2007:

     $1.5 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement. In November 2007, we restructured our $1.75 billion
credit agreement to eliminate the $0.5 billion deposit letter of credit facility and to increase
the revolving credit facility from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion. El Paso and certain of its
subsidiaries have guaranteed the $1.5 billion revolving credit agreement, which is collateralized
by our stock ownership in EPNG and TGP who are also eligible borrowers under the $1.5 billion
revolving credit agreement.

     Under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which matures in November 2012, we can borrow
funds at LIBOR plus 1.25% based on a current applicable margin or issue letters of credit at 1.375%
of the amount issued. We pay an annual commitment fee of 0.25% (based on a current applicable
margin) on any unused capacity under the revolving credit facility. Under the credit agreement, the
applicable margin used to calculate interest on borrowings, letters of credit and commitment fees
is determined by a variable pricing grid tied to the credit ratings of our senior secured debt. As
of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $0.3 billion of
letters of credit issued and $0.4
billion of debt outstanding under this facility.

     Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. We have a $500 million unsecured revolving credit
facility that matures in July 2011 with a third party and a third party trust that provides for
both borrowings and issuing letters of credit. We are required to pay fixed facility fees at a rate
of 2.34% on the total committed amount of the facility. In addition, we will pay interest on any
borrowings at a rate comprised of either LIBOR or a base rate. Substantially all of the capacity under this facility
was used to issue letters of credit.

     Unsecured Credit Facility. In June 2007, we entered into a $150 million unsecured facility
that provides for both borrowings and issuing letters of credit. As of December 31, 2007, we had
increased the capacity under this facility to $500 million. The facility matures in various
tranches during 2009. Based on this facility size, we are required to pay a fixed facility fee at a
weighted average rate of 1.58% per annum on the full facility amount. Borrowings carry an interest
rate of LIBOR in addition to the facility fee. Substantially all of
the capacity under the facility has been used to issue
letters of credit.

Table of Contents

     EPEP $1.0 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement. In September 2007, we amended and restated
EPEPs revolving credit facility, increasing the capacity by $0.5 billion to $1.0 billion. The
other material terms and conditions of this facility remain the same. As of December 31, 2007, we
had $0.8 billion outstanding under this facility. Based on current borrowing levels, we pay
interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% on borrowings, and a commitment fee of 0.30% on any unused capacity.
This facility is
collateralized by certain of our natural gas and oil properties, which are subject to revaluation
on a semi-annual basis. As of December 31, 2007, the most recent determination was sufficient to
fully support this facility.

     Contingent Letter of Credit Facility. We have a $250 million unsecured contingent letter of
credit facility that matures in March 2008. Letters of credit are available to us under the
facility if the average NYMEX gas price strip for the remaining calendar months through March 2008
is equal to or exceeds $11.75 per MMBtu. The facility fee, if triggered, is 1.66% per annum.

     El Paso Pipeline
Partners, L.P. Revolving Credit Facility. In November 2007, EPPP and WIC, their subsidiary, entered into an unsecured 5-year revolving credit
facility with an initial aggregate borrowing capacity of up to
$750 million expandable to $1.25 billion for certain
expansion projects and acquisitions. This facility is only
available to EPPP and its subsidiaries and borrowings are guaranteed
by EPPP or its
subsidiaries. Amounts borrowed are non-recourse to El Paso. Approximately $455 million was
outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2007.
The  credit facility has two pricing grids, one based on credit
ratings and the other based on leverage. Currently, the leverage
pricing grid is in effect and EPPPs cost of borrowings is LIBOR
plus 0.525% based on EPPPs current leverage. EPPP also pays a
0.125% annual commitment fee for this facility.

     Letters of Credit. We enter into letters of credit in the ordinary course of our operating
activities as well as periodically in conjunction with the sales of assets or businesses. As of
December 31, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $1.3 billion. Included in
this amount is $1.0 billion of letters of credit securing our recorded obligations related to price
risk management activities.

     Restrictive Covenants

     $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. Our covenants under the $1.5 billion revolving
credit facility include restrictions on debt levels, restrictions on liens securing debt and
guarantees, restrictions on mergers and on the sales of assets, dividend restrictions, cross
default and cross-acceleration. A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of
our debt and other financial obligations and that of our subsidiaries. Under our credit agreement
the most restrictive debt covenants and cross default provisions are:




 
(a)
 
Our ratio of Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the credit agreement, shall
not exceed 5.5 to 1 at anytime prior to June 30, 2008. Thereafter it shall not exceed 5.25
to 1 until maturity;


 

 
(b)
 
Our ratio of Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, to interest expense
plus dividends paid shall not be less than 1.75 to 1 at anytime prior to June 30, 2008.
Thereafter it shall not be less than 2.00 to 1 until maturity;


 

 
(c)
 
EPNG and TGP cannot incur incremental Debt if the incurrence of this incremental Debt
would cause their Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, each as defined in the credit
agreement, for that particular company to exceed 5.0 to 1; and


 

 
(d)
 
the occurrence of an event of default and after the expiration of any applicable grace
period, with respect to Debt in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million or more.



     EPEP $1.0 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement. EPEPs borrowings under this facility are
subject to various conditions. The financial coverage ratio under the facility requires that EPEPs
EBITDA, as defined in the facility, to interest expense not be less than 2.0 to 1 and EPEPs debt
to EBITDA, each as defined in the credit agreement, must not exceed 4.0 to 1.

113

Table of Contents

     EPPP Revolving Credit Facility. EPPPs borrowings under the credit facility contains
covenants and provisions, the most restrictive of which requires EPPP to maintain, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, a
consolidated leverage ratio (consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the
credit facility)) of less than 5.0 to 1.0 for any four consecutive quarters; and 5.5 to 1.0 for any
three consecutive quarters subsequent to the consummation of specified permitted acquisitions
having a value greater than $25 million. EPPP has also added additional flexibility to their
covenants for growth projects. In case of a capital construction or expansion project in excess of
$20 million, adjustments to consolidated EBITDA, approved by the lenders, may be made
based on the percentage of capital costs expended and projected cash flows for the project. Such
adjustments shall be limited to 25% of actual EBITDA.

     Other Restrictions and Provisions. In addition to the above restrictions and provisions, we
and/or our subsidiaries are subject to a number of additional restrictions and covenants. These
restrictions and covenants include limitations of additional debt at some of our subsidiaries;
limitations on the use of proceeds from borrowing at some of our subsidiaries; limitations, in some
cases, on transactions with our affiliates; limitations on the occurrence of liens; potential
limitations on the ability of some of our subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends and potential
limitations on some of our subsidiaries to participate in our cash management program. Our most
restrictive acceleration provision is $10 million and is associated with the indenture of one of
our subsidiaries. This indenture states that should an event of default occur resulting in the
acceleration of other debt obligations in excess of $10 million, the long-term debt obligation
containing that provision could be accelerated. The acceleration of our debt would adversely affect
our liquidity position and in turn, our financial condition.

     We have also issued various guarantees securing financial obligations of our subsidiaries and
affiliates with similar covenants as the above facilities.

     Other Financing Arrangements

     Capital Trusts. El Paso Energy Capital Trust I (Trust I), is a wholly owned business trust
formed in March 1998 that issued 6.5 million of 4.75 percent trust convertible preferred securities
for $325 million. Trust I exists for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and investing
the proceeds in 4.75 percent convertible subordinated debentures we issued, which are due 2028.
Trust Is sole source of income is interest earned on these debentures. This interest income is
used to pay distributions on the preferred securities. We also have two wholly owned business
trusts, El Paso Energy Capital Trust II and III (Trust II and III), under which we have not issued
securities. We provide a full and unconditional guarantee of Trust Is preferred securities, and
would provide the same guarantee if securities were issued under Trust II and III.

     Trust Is preferred securities are non-voting (except in limited circumstances), pay quarterly
distributions at an annual rate of 4.75 percent, carry a liquidation value of $50 per security plus
accrued and unpaid distributions and are convertible into our common shares at any time prior to
the close of business on March 31, 2028, at the option of the holder at a rate of 1.2022 common
shares for each Trust I preferred security (equivalent to a conversion price of $41.59 per common
share). We have classified these securities as long-term debt and we have the right to redeem these
securities at any time.

     Non-Recourse Project Financings. Several of our subsidiaries and investments have debt
obligations related to their costs of construction or acquisition. This project financing
debt is recourse only to the project company and assets (i.e. without recourse to El Paso).
As of December 31, 2007, two international power projects accounted for as equity
investments are in default under their debt agreements; however, we
have no material exposure as a result of these defaults.

Legal Proceedings

     ERISA Class Action Suit. In December 2002, a purported class action lawsuit entitled William
H. Lewis, III v. El Paso Corporation, et al. was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Texas alleging that our communication with participants in our Retirement Savings Plan
included various misrepresentations and omissions that caused members of the class to hold and
maintain investments in El Paso stock in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(ERISA). Various motions have been filed and we are awaiting the courts ruling. We have insurance
coverage for this lawsuit, subject to certain deductibles and co-pay obligations. We have
established accruals for this matter which we believe are adequate.

     Cash Balance Plan Lawsuit. In December 2004, a purported class action lawsuit entitled
Tomlinson, et al. v. El Paso Corporation and El Paso Corporation Pension Plan was filed in U.S.
District Court for Denver, Colorado. The lawsuit alleges various violations of ERISA and the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act as a result of our change from a final average earnings formula
pension plan to a cash balance pension plan. Certain of the claims that our cash balance plan
violated ERISA were recently dismissed by the trial court. Our costs and legal exposure related to
this lawsuit are not currently determinable.

     Shareholder
Litigation. In 2007, we settled twenty-eight shareholder class action
lawsuits that had alleged violations of federal securities laws by us and several of our current and former officers and
directors. Under the settlement, we contributed approximately
$48 million, our insurers
contributed approximately $225 million, and a third party contributed $12 million.

     Retiree Medical Benefits Matters. We serve as the plan administrator for a medical benefits
plan that covers a closed group of retirees of the Case Corporation who retired on or before July
1, 1994. Case was formerly a subsidiary of Tenneco, Inc. that was spun off in 1994. Tenneco
retained an obligation to provide certain medical benefits at the time of the spin-off and we
assumed this obligation as a result of our merger with Tenneco. Pursuant to an agreement with the
applicable union for Case employees, our liability for these benefits was subject to a cap, such
that costs in excess of the cap were to be assumed by plan participants. In 2002, we and Case were
sued by individual retirees in a federal court in Detroit, Michigan in an action entitled Yolton et
al. v. El Paso Tennessee Pipeline Co. and Case Corporation. The suit alleges, among other things,
that El Paso and Case violated ERISA and that they should be required to pay all amounts above the
cap. Case further filed claims against El Paso asserting that El Paso was obligated to indemnify
Case for the amounts it would be required to pay. In separate rulings in 2004, the court ruled
that, pending a trial on the merits, Case must pay the amounts incurred above the cap and that El
Paso must reimburse Case for those payments. In January 2006, these rulings were upheld on appeal
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. In October 2007, pending a trial on the merits,
the court expanded the number of retirees covered by its prior preliminary rulings. We will proceed
with a trial on the merits with regard to the issues of whether the cap is enforceable and to what
degree benefits have actually vested. Until this is resolved, El Paso will indemnify Case for
payments Case makes above the cap, which are currently about $2 million per month. We continue to
defend the action and have filed for approval by the trial court various amendments to the medical
benefit plans which would allow us to deliver the benefits to plan participants in a more cost
effective manner. Although it is uncertain what plan amendments will ultimately be approved, the
approval of plan amendments could reduce our overall costs and, as a result, could reduce our
recorded obligation. We have established an accrual for this matter which we believe is adequate
and further discussed in guarantees and indemnifications below.

     Natural Gas Commodities Litigation. Beginning in August 2003, several lawsuits were filed
against El Paso Marketing L.P. (EPM) alleging that El Paso, EPM and other energy companies
conspired to manipulate the price of natural gas by providing false price information to industry
trade publications that published gas indices. The first cases were consolidated in federal court
in New York for all pre-trial purposes and were styled In re: Gas Commodity Litigation. In
September 2005, the court certified the class to include all persons who purchased or sold NYMEX
natural gas futures between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2002. A settlement was finalized and
has been paid. The second set of cases, involving similar allegations on behalf of commercial and
residential customers, was transferred to a multi-district litigation proceeding (MDL) in the U.S.
District Court for Nevada and styled In re: Western States Wholesale Natural Gas Antitrust
Litigation. These cases were dismissed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however,
reversed the dismissal and ordered that these cases be remanded to the trial court. A petition for
certiorari has been filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. The third set of cases also involve similar
allegations on behalf of certain purchasers of natural gas. These include Farmland Industries v.
Oneok Inc., et al. (filed in state court in Wyandotte County, Kansas in July 2005) and Missouri
Public Service Commission v. El Paso Corporation, et al. (filed in the circuit court of Jackson
County, Missouri at Kansas City in October 2006), and the purported class action lawsuits styled:
Leggett, et al. v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al. (filed in Chancery Court of Tennessee in January
2005); Ever-Bloom Inc., et al. v. AEP Energy Services Inc., et al. (filed in federal court for

115

the Eastern District of California in September 2005); Learjet, Inc., et al. v. Oneok Inc., et al.
(filed in state court in Wyandotte County, Kansas in September 2005); Breckenridge, et al. v. Oneok
Inc., et al. (filed in state court in Denver County, Colorado in May 2006); Arandell, et al. v.
Xcel Energy, et al. (filed in the circuit court of Dane County, Wisconsin in December 2006); and
Heartland, et al. v. Oneok Inc., et al. (filed in the circuit court of Buchanan County, Missouri in
March 2007). The Leggett case was dismissed by the Tennessee state court and has been appealed.
The remaining cases have all been transferred to the MDL proceeding. The Missouri Public Service
case has been remanded to state court. Dispositive motions have been filed or are anticipated to
be filed in these cases. Our costs and legal exposure related to these lawsuits and claims are not
currently determinable.

     Gas Measurement Cases. A number of our subsidiaries were named defendants in actions that
generally allege mismeasurement of natural gas volumes and/or heating content resulting in the
underpayment of royalties. The first set of cases was filed in 1997 by an individual under the
False Claims Act, which have been consolidated for pretrial purposes (In re: Natural Gas Royalties
Qui Tam Litigation, U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming). These complaints allege an
industry-wide conspiracy to underreport the heating value as well as the volumes of the natural gas
produced from federal and Native American lands. In October 2006, the U.S. District Judge issued an
order dismissing all claims against all defendants. An appeal has been filed.

     Similar allegations were filed in a set of actions initiated in 1999 in Will Price, et al. v.
Gas Pipelines and Their Predecessors, et al., in the District Court of Stevens County, Kansas. The
plaintiffs currently seek certification of a class of royalty owners in wells on non-federal and
non-Native American lands in Kansas, Wyoming and Colorado. Motions for class certification have
been briefed and argued in the proceedings and the parties are awaiting the courts ruling. The
plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages in the form of additional royalty
payments (along with interest, expenses and punitive damages) and injunctive relief with regard to
future gas measurement practices. Our costs and legal exposure related to these lawsuits and claim
are not currently determinable.

     MTBE. Certain of our subsidiaries used the gasoline additive methyl tertiary-butyl ether
(MTBE) in some of their gasoline. Certain subsidiaries have also produced, bought, sold and
distributed MTBE. A number of lawsuits have been filed throughout the U.S. regarding the potential
impact of MTBE on water supplies. Some of our subsidiaries are among the defendants in
approximately 80 such lawsuits. The plaintiffs, certain state attorneys general, various water
districts and a limited number of individual water customers, generally seek remediation of their
groundwater, prevention of future contamination, damages (including natural resource damages),
punitive damages, attorneys fees and court costs. Among other allegations, plaintiffs assert that
gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that defendant refiners are liable in
proportion to their market share. Although these suits had been consolidated for pre-trial
purposes in multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York, a recent appellate court decision directed two of the cases to be remanded back to state
court. A limited number of cases have since been remanded to separate state court proceedings. It
is possible many of the other cases will also be remanded. We have
reached an agreement in
principle with the plaintiffs to settle approximately 60 of the lawsuits. We have also reached an
agreement in principle with our insurers, whereby our insurers would fund substantially all of the
consideration to be provided by our subsidiaries under the terms of the settlement with the
plaintiffs. Approximately 20 of the remaining lawsuits are not covered by the terms of this
settlement. While the damages claimed in these remaining actions are substantial there remains
significant legal uncertainty regarding the validity of the causes of action asserted and the
availability of the relief sought by the plaintiffs. We have tendered these remaining cases to our
insurers. Our costs and legal exposure related to these remaining lawsuits are not currently
determinable.

Government Investigations and Inquiries

     Reserve Revisions. In March 2004, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents
relating to our December 31, 2003 natural gas and oil reserve revisions. We continue to cooperate
with the SEC in its investigation related to such reserve revisions. We originally self-reported
this matter to the SEC and have been cooperating fully with the investigation, which has included
producing a large volume of documents and making our employees available for interviews or
testimony upon request. On July 13, 2007, we received a notice indicating the SEC staff has made a
preliminary decision to recommend to the SEC that it institute an enforcement action against us and
two of our subsidiaries related to the reserve revisions. We understand that the staff of the SEC
may have also issued similar notices to several of our former employees related to the reserves
revisions. We were given the opportunity to respond to the staff before it makes its formal
recommendation on whether any action should be brought by the SEC, and on September 25, 2007 we
submitted our response.

     Legacy
Crude Oil Trading. In 2007, we recorded $77 million of other income in our income statement
related to the reversal of amounts accrued prior to 2001 relating to shipments of crude oil
allegedly purchased by Coastal in 1990. We reversed these amounts following the expiration of the related statute of limitation
periods and the completion of a review of
the matter and related defenses.

Table of Contents

     In addition to the above proceedings, we and our subsidiaries and affiliates are named
defendants in numerous lawsuits and governmental proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
our business. There are also other regulatory rules and orders in various stages of adoption,
review and/or implementation. For each of these matters, we evaluate the merits of the case, our
exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies and the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome. If we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and can be estimated,
we establish the necessary accruals. While the outcome of these matters, including those discussed
above, cannot be predicted with certainty, and there are still uncertainties related to the costs
we may incur, based upon our evaluation and experience to date, we believe we have established
appropriate reserves for these matters. It is possible, however, that new information or future
developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to these matters and
adjust our accruals accordingly, and these adjustments could be material. As of December 31, 2007,
we had approximately $460 million accrued, net of related insurance receivables, for our
outstanding legal and governmental proceedings.

Rates and Regulatory Matters

     Notice of Inquiry on Pipeline Fuel Retention Policies. In September 2007, the FERC issued a
Notice of Inquiry regarding its policy about the in-kind recovery of fuel and lost and unaccounted
for gas by natural gas pipeline companies. Under current policy, pipelines have options for
recovering these costs. For some pipelines, the tariff states a fixed percentage as a
non-negotiable fee-in-kind retained from the volumes tendered for shipment by each shipper. There
is also a tracker approach, where the pipelines tariff provides for prospective adjustments to the
fuel retention rates from time-to-time, but does not include a mechanism to allow the pipeline to
reconcile past over or under-recoveries of fuel. Finally, some pipelines tariffs provide for a
tracker with a true-up approach, where provisions in a pipelines tariff allow for periodic
adjustments to the fuel retention rates, and also provide for a true-up of past over and
under-recoveries of fuel and lost and unaccounted for gas. In this proceeding, the FERC is seeking
comments on whether it should change its current policy and prescribe a uniform method for all
pipelines to use in recovering these costs. Our pipeline subsidiaries currently utilize a variety
of these methodologies. At this time, we do not know what impact this proceeding may
ultimately have on any of us.

     Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking. On October 3, 2007, the Minerals Management Service (MMS)
issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Oil and Gas and Sulphur Operations in the Outer
Continental Shelf  Pipelines and Pipeline Rights-of-Way. If adopted, the proposed rules would
substantially revise MMS Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) pipeline and rights-of-way (ROW)
regulations. The proposed rules would have the effect of: (1) increasing the financial obligations
of entities, like us, which have pipelines and pipeline rights-of-way in the OCS; (2) increasing
the regulatory requirements imposed on the operation and maintenance of existing pipelines in the
OCS; and (3) increasing the requirements and preconditions for
obtaining new rights-of-way in the
OCS. .

     EPNG. In August 2007, EPNG received approval of the settlement of its rate case from the FERC.
The settlement provides benefits for both EPNG and its customers for a three year period ending
December 31, 2008. Under the terms of the settlement, EPNG is required to file a new rate case to
be effective January 1, 2009. EPNG received approval from the FERC to begin billing the settlement
rates on October 1, 2007. Our financial statements reflect EPNGs settled rates. Additionally, in
2007 and 2006, we recorded rate refund provisions of approximately $60 million and $65 million
inclusive of interest, which we reflected as accrued liabilities on our balance sheet. In the
fourth quarter of 2007, EPNG refunded $115 million including interest in rate refunds to its
customers and refunded the remaining $10 million in January 2008.

Other Contingencies

     Navajo Nation. Approximately 900 looped pipeline miles of the north mainline of our EPNG
pipeline system are located on lands held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the
Navajo Nation. Our rights-of-way on lands crossing the Navajo Nation are the subject of a pending
renewal application filed in 2005 with the Department of the Interiors Bureau of Indian Affairs.
An interim agreement with the Navajo Nation expired at the end of December 2006. Negotiations on
the terms of the long-term agreement are continuing. In addition, we continue to preserve other
legal, regulatory and legislative alternatives, which include continuing to pursue our application
with the Department of the Interior for renewal of our rights-of-way on Navajo Nation lands. It is
uncertain whether our negotiation, or other alternatives, will be successful, or if successful,
what the ultimate cost will be of obtaining the rights-of-way and whether we will be able to
recover these costs in EPNGs rates.

Environmental Matters

     We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental
quality and pollution control. These laws and regulations require us to remove or remedy the effect
on the environment of the disposal or release of specified substances at current and former
operating sites. At December 31, 2007, we accrued approximately $260 million, which has not been
reduced by $27 million for amounts to be paid directly under government sponsored programs. Our
accrual includes approximately $251 million for expected remediation costs and associated onsite,
offsite and groundwater technical studies and approximately $9 million for related environmental
legal costs. Of the $260 million accrual, $22 million was reserved for facilities we currently
operate and $238 million was reserved for non-operating sites (facilities that are shut down or
have been sold) and Superfund sites.

     Our estimates of potential liability range from approximately $260 million to approximately
$470 million. Our accrual represents a combination of two estimation methodologies. First, where
the most likely outcome can be reasonably estimated, that cost has been accrued ($18 million).
Second, where the most likely outcome cannot be estimated, a range of costs is established ($242
million to $452 million) and if no one amount in that range is more likely than any other, the
lower end of the expected range has been accrued. Our environmental remediation projects are in
various stages of completion. Our recorded liabilities reflect our current estimates of amounts we
will expend to remediate these sites. However, depending on the stage of completion or assessment,
the ultimate extent of contamination or remediation required may not be known. As additional
assessments occur or remediation efforts continue, we may incur additional liabilities. By type of
site, our reserves are based on the following estimates of reasonably possible outcomes:

For 2008, we estimate that our total remediation expenditures will be approximately $65 million,
most of which will be expended under government directed clean-up plans. In addition, we expect to
make capital expenditures for environmental matters of approximately $7 million in the aggregate
for the years 2008 through 2011. These expenditures primarily relate to compliance with clean air
regulations.

     CERCLA Matters. We have received notice that we could be designated, or have been asked for
information to determine whether we could be designated, as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP)
with respect to 44 active sites under the Comprehensive Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA) or state equivalents. We have sought to resolve our liability as a PRP at these sites
through indemnification by third parties and settlements, which provide for payment of our
allocable share of remediation costs. As of December 31, 2007, we have estimated our share of the
remediation costs at these sites to be between $27 million and $49 million. Because the clean-up
costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the
extent of remediation required, and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability, our
estimates could change. Moreover, liability under the federal CERCLA statute is joint and several,
meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs. Our
understanding of the financial strength of other PRPs has been considered, where appropriate, in
estimating our liabilities. Accruals for these issues are included in the previously indicated
estimates for Superfund sites.

     It is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our
potential exposure related to environmental matters. We may incur significant costs and liabilities
in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that other
developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws, regulations and orders of regulatory
agencies, as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees
and other persons resulting from our current or past operations, could result in substantial costs
and liabilities in the future. As this information becomes available, or other relevant
developments occur, we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly. While there are still
uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur, based upon our evaluation and experience
to date, we believe our reserves are adequate.

Commitments, Purchase Obligations and Other Matters

     Operating Leases. We maintain operating leases in the ordinary course of our business
activities. These leases include those for office space, operating facilities and equipment. The
terms of the agreements vary from 2008 until 2053. Minimum annual rental commitments under our
operating leases at December 31, 2007, were as follows:

Amounts have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of approximately $1 million due
in the future under noncancelable subleases.


     Rental expense on our lease obligations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005
was $40 million, $43 million and $53 million, which includes $27 million in 2005 related to
consolidating our Houston-based operations.

     Guarantees. We are involved in various joint ventures and other ownership arrangements that
sometimes require financial and performance guarantees. In a financial guarantee, we are obligated
to make payments if the guaranteed party fails to make payments under, or violates the terms of,
the financial arrangement. In a performance guarantee, we provide assurance that the guaranteed
party will execute on the terms of the contract. If they do not, we are required to perform on
their behalf. We also periodically provide indemnification arrangements related to assets or
businesses we have sold. These arrangements include, but are not limited to, indemnification for
income taxes, the resolution of existing disputes and environmental matters.

     Our potential exposure under guarantee and indemnification agreements can range from a
specified amount to an unlimited dollar amount, depending on the nature of the claim and the
particular transaction. For those arrangements with a specified dollar amount, we have a maximum
stated value of approximately $785 million, for which we are indemnified by third parties for $15
million. These amounts exclude guarantees for which we have issued related letters of credit
discussed in Note 11. Included in the above maximum stated value is approximately $438 million
related to indemnification arrangements associated with the sale of ANR and related operations and
approximately $119 million related to tax matters, related interest and other indemnifications and
guarantees arising out of the sale of our Macae power facility. As of December 31, 2007, we have
recorded obligations of $51 million related to our guarantees and indemnification arrangements, of
which $8 million is related to ANR and related assets and Macae. We are unable to estimate a
maximum exposure for our guarantee and indemnification agreements that do not provide for limits on
the amount of future payments due to the uncertainty of these exposures.

     In addition to the exposures described above, a trial court has ruled, which was upheld on
appeal, that we are required to indemnify a third party for benefits being paid to a closed group
of retirees of one of our former subsidiaries. We have a liability of approximately $379 million
associated with our estimated exposure under this matter as of December 31, 2007. For a further
discussion of this matter, see Retiree Medical Benefits Matters above.

     Other Commercial Commitments. We have various other commercial commitments and purchase
obligations that are not recorded on our balance sheet. At December 31, 2007, we had firm
commitments under transportation and storage capacity contracts of
$195 million due at various times and other purchase
and capital commitments (including maintenance, engineering, procurement and construction
contracts) of $709 million, the substantial majority of which is
due in less than one year.

     We also hold cancelable easements or right-of-way arrangements from landowners permitting the
use of land for the construction and operation of our pipeline systems. Currently, our obligation
under these easements is not material to the results of our operations. However, we are currently
negotiating a long-term right-of-way agreement with the Navajo Nation which could result in a
significant commitment by us (see Navajo Nation above).

13. Retirement Benefits

     Overview of Retirement Benefits

          Pension Benefits. Our primary pension plan is a defined benefit plan that covers
substantially all of our U.S. employees and provides benefits under a cash balance formula. Certain
employees who participated in the prior pension plans of El Paso, Sonat, Inc. or The Coastal
Corporation receive the greater of cash balance benefits or transition benefits under the prior
plan formulas. We do not anticipate making any contributions to this pension plan in 2008.

          In addition to our primary pension plan, we maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(SERP) that provides additional benefits to selected officers and key management. The SERP provides
benefits in excess of certain IRS limits that essentially mirror those in the primary pension plan.
We expect to contribute $4 million to the SERP in 2008. We also maintain two other frozen pension
plans that are closed to new participants which provide benefits to former employees of our
previously discontinued coal and convenience store operations. We do not anticipate making any
contributions to our frozen pension plans in 2008. The SERP and the frozen plans together are
referred to below as other pension plans. We also participate in several multi-employer pension
plans for the benefit of our former employees who were union members. Our contributions to these
plans during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were not material.

          Retirement Savings Plan. We maintain a defined contribution plan covering all of our U.S.
employees. We match 75 percent of participant basic contributions up to 6 percent of eligible
compensation and can make additional discretionary matching contributions depending on our
performance relative to our peers. Amounts expensed under this plan were approximately $16 million,
$30 million and $25 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

          Other Postretirement Benefits. We provide postretirement medical benefits for closed groups
of retired employees and limited postretirement life insurance benefits for current and retired
employees. Other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB) for our regulated pipeline companies are
prefunded to the extent such costs are recoverable through rates. To the extent OPEB costs for our
regulated pipeline companies differ from the amounts recovered in rates, a regulatory asset or
liability is recorded. We expect to contribute $27 million to our postretirement plans in 2008.
Medical benefits for these closed groups of retirees may be subject to deductibles, co-payment
provisions, and other limitations and dollar caps on the amount of employer costs, and we reserve
the right to change these benefits.

     Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 158, and upon adoption we reflected the assets and liabilities related to
our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their funded or unfunded status and all
actuarial deferrals were reclassified as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The
adoption of this standard decreased our other non-current assets by $601 million, our other
non-current deferred tax liabilities by $210 million, and our accumulated other comprehensive
income by $391 million. In March 2007, the FERC issued guidance requiring regulated pipeline
companies to recognize a regulatory asset or liability for the funded status asset or liability
that would otherwise be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income under SFAS No. 158, if
it is probable that amounts calculated on the same basis as SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, would be included in our rates in future periods. Upon
adoption of this FERC guidance, we reclassified approximately $9 million from the beginning balance
of accumulated other comprehensive income to regulatory liabilities, which is included in other
non-current liabilities on our balance sheet.

     Our accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $2.0 billion and
$2.1 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our projected benefit obligation and accumulated
benefit obligation for our pension plans whose accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair
value of plan assets, was $37 million as of December 31, 2007 and $167 million as of December 31,
2006.

     Our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our other postretirement benefit plans
whose accumulated postretirement benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets was
$222 million and $320 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

     Our accumulated other comprehensive income includes approximately $8 million of unamortized
prior service costs, net of tax. We anticipate that approximately $16 million of our accumulated
other comprehensive loss, net of tax, will be recognized as a part of our net periodic benefit cost
in 2008.

     Change in Benefit Obligation, Plan Assets and Funded Status. Our benefits are presented and
computed as of and for the twelve months ended September 30:

We defer the difference between our actual return on plan assets and our expected return over a three year period, after which they are considered for inclusion in net benefit expense or
income. Our deferred actuarial gains and losses are amortized only to
the extent that our remaining unrecognized actual gains and losses exceed the greater of 10 percent of our projected
benefit obligations or market related value of plan assets.

As permitted, the amortization of any prior service
cost is determined using a straight-line amortization of
the cost over the average remaining service period of
employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.


     Actuarial Assumptions and Sensitivity Analysis. Projected benefit obligations and net benefit
cost are based on actuarial estimates and assumptions. The following table details the
weighted-average actuarial assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation and net
benefit costs of our pension and other postretirement plans for 2007, 2006 and 2005:

The expected return on plan assets is a pre-tax rate
of return based on our targeted portfolio of investments.
Some of our postretirement benefit plans investment
earnings are subject to unrelated business income tax at a
rate of 35%. The expected return on plan assets for our
postretirement benefit plans is calculated using the
after-tax rate of return.


     Actuarial estimates for our other postretirement benefit plans assumed a weighted-average
annual rate of increase in the per capita costs of covered health care benefits of 9.4 percent,
gradually decreasing to 5.0 percent by the year 2015. Assumed health care cost trends have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for other postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage
point change in assumed health care cost trends would have the following effects as of September
30:

     Plan Assets. The primary investment objective of our plans is to ensure that over the
long-term life of the plans an adequate pool of sufficiently liquid assets to meet the benefit
obligations to participants, retirees and beneficiaries exists. Investment objectives are
long-term in nature covering typical market cycles of three to five years. Any shortfall of
investment performance compared to investment objectives is the result of general economic and
capital market conditions. The following table provides the target and actual asset allocations in
our pension and other postretirement benefit plans as of September 30:

     Other Matters. A trial court has ruled, which was upheld on appeal, that we are required to
indemnify a third party for benefits paid to a closed group of retirees. We estimated our liability
under this ruling utilizing actuarial methods similar to those used in estimating our obligations
associated with our other postretirement benefit plans; however, these legal reserves are not
included in the disclosures related to our pension and other postretirement benefits above. For a
further discussion of this matter, see Note 12.




14. Stockholders Equity and Minority Interest

      Stockholders Equity

     Common Stock. In 2006, we issued 35.7 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of
approximately $500 million. In 2005, we issued approximately 13.6 million shares of common stock to
the remaining holders of $272 million of notes which originally formed a portion of our equity
security units in settlement of their commitment to purchase the shares.

     Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock. In 2005, we issued $750 million of convertible
perpetual preferred stock. Dividends on the preferred stock are declared quarterly at the rate of
4.99% per annum if approved by our Board of Directors and dividends accumulate if not paid. Each
share of the preferred stock is convertible at the holders option, at any time, subject to
adjustment, into 76.7754 shares of our common stock under certain conditions. This conversion rate
represents an equivalent conversion price of approximately $13.03 per share. The conversion rate is
subject to adjustment based on certain events which include, but are not limited to, fundamental
changes in our business such as mergers or business combinations as well as distributions of our
common stock or adjustments to the current rate of dividends on our common stock. We will be able
to cause the preferred stock to be converted into common stock five years after issuance if our
common stock is trading at a premium of 130 percent to the conversion price.

     The net proceeds from the issuance of the preferred stock, along with cash
on hand, was used to settle litigation of approximately $442 million and to
redeem all of the 6 million outstanding shares of 8.25% Series A cumulative preferred stock of our
subsidiary, El Paso Tennessee Pipeline Company for approximately $300 million.

     Dividends. The table below shows the amount of dividends paid and declared (in millions,
except per share amounts):

     Dividends on our common stock and preferred stock are treated as reduction of additional
paid-in-capital since we currently have an accumulated deficit. We expect dividends paid on our
common and preferred stock in 2007 will be taxable to our stockholders because we anticipate that
these dividends will be paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits for tax purposes.

123

Table of Contents

     The terms of our 750,000 outstanding shares of 4.99% convertible preferred stock prohibit the
payment of dividends on our common stock unless we have paid or set aside for payment all
accumulated and unpaid dividends on such preferred stock for all preceding dividend periods. In
addition, although our credit facilities do not contain any direct restriction on the payment of
dividends, dividends are included as a fixed charge in the calculation of our fixed charge coverage
ratio under our credit facilities. If our fixed charge ratio were to exceed the permitted maximum
level, our ability to pay additional dividends would be restricted.

     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The following table provides the components of our

Minority Interest

     In November 2007, we issued common units in our subsidiary El Paso Pipeline Partners, L.P., a master
limited partnership and accordingly recorded minority interest on our
balance sheet of $537 million. Under its partnership agreement,
the MLP is obligated to distribute available cash as defined in the
agreement. Currently, the MLPs minimum quarterly distribution on its
common units is $0.2875/unit
per quarter.




15. Stock-Based Compensation

     Overview. Under our stock-based compensation plans, we may issue to our employees incentive
stock options on our common stock (intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code), non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation
rights, performance shares, performance units and other stock-based awards. We are authorized to
grant awards of approximately 42.5 million shares of our common stock under our current plans,
which includes 35 million shares under our employee plan, 2.5 million shares under our non-employee
director plan and 5 million shares under our employee stock purchase plan. At December 31, 2007,
approximately 29 million shares remain available for grant under our current plans. In addition, we
have approximately 18 million shares of stock option awards outstanding that were granted under
terminated plans that obligate us to issue additional shares of common stock if they are exercised.
Stock option exercises and restricted stock are funded primarily through the issuance of new common
shares.

     We record stock-based compensation expense, excluding amounts capitalized, as operation and
maintenance expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, net of estimates of
forfeitures. If actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, additional adjustments to
compensation expense will be required in future periods.

     Non-Qualified Stock Options. We grant non-qualified stock options to our employees with an
exercise price equal to the market value of our stock on the grant date. Our stock option awards
have contractual terms of 10 years and generally vest in equal amounts over three years from the
grant date. We do not pay dividends on unexercised options. A summary of our stock option
transactions for the year ended December 31, 2007 is presented below:

     In
2007 and 2006, we recognized $16 million and $11 million of pre-tax compensation expense on
stock options, capitalized approximately $4 million and $2 million of this expense in each respective year as
part of fixed assets and recorded $6 million and $4 million of income tax benefits. Total
compensation cost related to non-vested option awards not yet recognized at December 31, 2007 was
approximately $16 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 10
months. Options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 had a total intrinsic
value of approximately $6 million and $5 million, generated $7 million and $6 million of cash
proceeds and did not generate any significant associated income tax benefit. The total intrinsic
value, cash received and income tax benefit generated from option exercises was not material during
the year ended December 31, 2005.

     Fair Value Assumptions. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date
of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on several assumptions. These assumptions
are based on managements best estimate at the time of grant. For the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005 the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted was
$5.53, $4.89, and $3.88.

     Listed below is the weighted average of each assumption based on grants in each fiscal year:

     We estimate expected volatility based on an analysis of implied volatilities from traded
options on our common stock and our historical stock price volatility over the expected term,
adjusted for certain time periods that we believe are not representative of future stock
performance. Prior to January 1, 2006, we estimated expected volatility based primarily on adjusted
historical stock price volatility. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 and estimate the expected term of our option awards based
on the vesting period and average remaining contractual term. We expect to continue to use this
approach for all stock option contracts consistent with SEC SAB No. 110, Share Based Payment, which allows us to continue the use
of the simplified method in estimating our expected term consistent with the manner in which we
determined expected term under SAB 107. We use this method due to a lack of sufficient
historical data to provide a reasonable basis for estimating our expected term based on significant
changes in the composition of our employees receiving stock-based compensation awards over the last
several years.
     Restricted Stock. We may grant shares of restricted common stock, which carry voting and
dividend rights, to our officers and employees. Sale or transfer of these shares is restricted
until they vest. We currently have outstanding and grant time-based restricted stock. The fair
value of our time-based restricted shares is determined on the grant date and these shares
generally vest in equal amounts over three years from the date of grant. A summary of the changes
in our non-vested restricted shares for each fiscal years are presented below:

     The weighted average grant date fair value per share for restricted stock granted during 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $14.73, $13.09 and $10.78. The total fair value of shares vested during 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $31 million, $24 million, and $14 million.

     During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized approximately $25 million, $17 million and $18
million of pre-tax compensation expense on our restricted share
awards, capitalized approximately $7
million in 2007 and $2 million in 2006 and 2005 as part of fixed assets and recorded $9 million,
$6 million and $6 million of income tax benefits related to restricted stock arrangements. The
total unrecognized compensation cost related to these arrangements at December 31, 2007 was
approximately $24 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 10
months.

     Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Our employee stock purchase plan allows participating employees
the right to purchase our common stock at 95 percent of the market price on the last trading day of
each month. This plan is non-compensatory under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Shares issued
under this plan were insignificant during 2007, 2006 and 2005.




16. Business Segment Information

     As of December 31, 2007, our business consists of two core segments, Pipelines and
Exploration and Production. We also have Marketing and Power segments. Prior to 2006, we also had
a Field Services segment. Our segments are strategic business units that provide a variety of
energy products and services. They are managed separately as each segment requires different
technology and marketing strategies. Our corporate activities include our general and
administrative functions, as well as other miscellaneous businesses and various other contracts and
assets, all of which are immaterial. A further discussion of each segment follows.

     Pipelines. Provides natural gas transmission, storage, and related services, primarily in
the United States. As of December 31, 2007, we conducted our activities primarily through
seven wholly or majority owned interstate pipeline systems and equity interests in three interstate transmission systems, along with two underground natural gas
storage entities and an LNG terminalling facility.

     Exploration and Production. Engaged in the exploration for and the acquisition, development
and production of natural gas, oil and NGL, primarily in the United States, Brazil and Egypt.

     Marketing. Markets and manages the price risks associated with our natural gas and oil
production as well as our remaining legacy trading portfolio.

     Power. Manages the risks associated with our remaining international power assets, primarily
in Brazil, Asia and Central America. We continue to pursue the sale of these assets.

     Prior
to January 1, 2006, we had a Field Services segment which conducted midstream activities.
We have disposed of substantially all of the assets in this segment.

     We had no customers whose revenues exceeded 10 percent of our total revenues in 2007, 2006 and
2005.

     Our management uses earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) to assess the
operating results and effectiveness of our business segments which
consist of both consolidated businesses and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. We believe EBIT is useful to our
investors because it allows them to more effectively evaluate the operating performance using the
same performance measure analyzed internally by our management. We define EBIT as net income or
loss adjusted for (i) items that do not impact our income or loss from continuing operations, such
as discontinued operations and the impact of accounting changes, (ii) income taxes and (iii)
interest and debt expense. We exclude interest and debt expense so that investors may evaluate our
operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. EBIT may not be
comparable to measures used by other companies. Additionally, EBIT should be considered in
conjunction with net income and other performance measures such as operating income or operating
cash flow. Below is a reconciliation of our EBIT to our income from continuing operations for the
periods ended December 31:

17. Investments in, Earnings from and Transactions with Unconsolidated Affiliates

     We hold investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. Our income statement typically reflects (i) our share of net earnings
directly attributable to these unconsolidated affiliates, and (ii) impairments and other
adjustments recorded by us.

     Our investment balance differs from the underlying net equity in our investments due primarily
to purchase price adjustments and impairment charges recorded by us. As of December 31, 2007 and
2006, our investment balance exceeded the net equity in the underlying net assets of these
investments by $377 million and $409 million due to these items. The majority of our purchase price
adjustments is related to our investment in Four Star which we acquired in 2005. We generally
amortize and assess the recoverability of this amount based on the development and production of
the underlying estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves of Four Star. Our net ownership
interest, investments in and earnings (losses) from our unconsolidated affiliates are as follows as
of and for the years ended December 31:

Amortization of our purchase cost in excess of the underlying net assets of Four Star was $53 million, $54 million and $20 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005.
During the third quarter of 2007, we paid $27 million to
increase our ownership interest in Four Star from 43 percent to 49 percent.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had outstanding advances and receivables not included in these balances of $350 million and $413 million related to our foreign
investments of which $12 million and $25 million related to our investment in Habibullah Power, $335 million and $350 million relate to our investment in Porto Velho, and
the remainder in our other foreign investments. We recognized interest income on these outstanding advances and receivables of approximately $1 million, $46 million, and
$47 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005. For a further discussion of these receivables, see Matters that Could Impact Our Investments below.

     Impairment charges and gains and losses on sales of equity investments are included in
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, our impairments and gains and
losses were primarily a result of our decision to sell a number of these investments or were based
on declines in their fair value of the investments due to changes in economics of the investments
underlying contracts, or the markets they serve. These gains (losses) consisted of the

     Accounts Receivable Sales Program. Several of our pipeline subsidiaries have agreements to
sell certain accounts receivable to qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) under SFAS No. 140,
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. As
of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we sold approximately
$189 million and $202 million, of receivables, received cash of
approximately $79 million and $108 million, received subordinated beneficial interests of approximately $107
million and $91 million, and recognized a loss of approximately $3 million in both years. In conjunction with the sale, the QSPEs
also issued senior beneficial interests on the receivables sold to a third party financial
institution, which totaled $80 million and $111 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. We reflect the subordinated beneficial
interest in receivables sold as accounts receivable from affiliates in our balance sheet. We
reflect accounts receivable sold under this program and changes in the subordinated beneficial
interests as operating cash flows in our statement of cash flows. Under the agreements, we earn a
fee for servicing the accounts receivable and performing all administrative duties for the QSPEs
which is reflected as a reduction of operation and maintenance expense in our income statement. The
fair value of these servicing and administrative agreements as well as the fees earned were not
material to our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Matters that Could Impact Our Investments

     International Power. During 2006, we completed the sales of our in
domestic power facilities and, accordingly, our remaining power investments are in international
power facilities. As of December 31, 2007, we had equity investments in six power generation and
transmission facilities in Asia, Central America, and Brazil that are considered variable interests
under FIN No. 46(R). We operate these facilities but do not supply a significant portion of the
fuel consumed or purchase a significant portion of the power generated by these facilities.
Additionally, the long-term debt issued by these entities is recourse only to the project. We have
investments in and advances to these entities as well as guarantees and other agreements which are
as follows at December 31, 2007:

     Porto Velho. We have an equity investment in and a note receivable from the Porto Velho
project in Brazil. The power generated by the Porto Velho project is committed to a state-owned
utility under power purchase agreements, the largest of which extends through 2023. In July 2007,
we received an offer from our partner to purchase our investment in the project for less than its
overall carrying value. Our discussions with our partner about this offer have been temporarily suspended pending the
resolution of certain claims with the state-owned utility, which are further described below, and a decision to
sell our investment has not been made at this time. The power markets in Brazil continue to evolve
and mature, and during the third quarter of 2007, the Brazilian national power grid operator
communicated to Porto Velhos management that its power plant (and the region that the plant
serves) will be interconnected to an integrated power grid in Brazil as soon as late 2008. When
the interconnection is completed, the state-owned utility will have access to sources of power at
rates that may be less than the price under Porto Velhos existing power purchase agreements.
Furthermore, there are plans to construct new hydroelectric plants in northern Brazil that could
reportedly be completed as early as 2012 which, once connected to the grid, could further reduce
regional power prices and the amount of power Porto Velho will be able to sell under its power
purchase agreements. Based on our assessment of the impact these ongoing developments may have on
northern Brazils electricity markets and Porto Velhos power purchase agreements, we recorded
incremental losses on our investment during 2007 of approximately $32 million. We also recorded a
$25 million impairment of our note receivable from the project, and have discontinued accruing
interest on the note. After these adjustments, our total investment in the Porto Velho project was
approximately $275 million as of December 31, 2007, comprised primarily of the note receivable from
the project. In February 2008, we received a dividend from the project of approximately $29
million, and we and our partner extended the date upon which we will be required to convert
approximately $80 million of the amounts due under this note into an equity investment in the
project until July 2008. In addition, we may be required to convert up to an additional $80
million of the note in July 2008, depending on the level of equity that our partner contributes to
the project, which would increase our percentage ownership in Porto Velho.

     In December 2006, the Brazilian tax authorities assessed a $30 million fine against the Porto
Velho power project for allegedly not filing the proper tax forms related to the delivery of fuel
to the power facility under its power purchase agreements. We believe the claim by the tax
authorities is without merit. In addition, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, the
state-owned utility made claims against the Porto Velho project for the period of 2003 through
2007 totaling approximately $60 million related to alleged excess fuel consumption. We believe
that we have valid defenses to these fuel claims. The state-owned utility has made additional net claims of $30 million for retroactive currency indexation adjustments, which are
partially offset by retroactive revenue surcharges for periods when
the plant uses oil for fuel.
We are currently evaluating this claim. Further adverse developments in the Brazilian power markets or
at the project could impact our ability to recover our remaining investment in the future.

     Manaus /Rio Negro. On January 15, 2008, we transferred our ownership in the Manaus and Rio
Negro facilities to the plants power purchaser as required by their power purchase agreements. On
the transfer date, we have approximately $69 million of accounts receivable owed to us under the projects terminated power purchase
agreements, which are guaranteed by the purchasers parent. The purchaser has withheld payment of
these receivables in light of a dispute over approximately $54 million of maintenance and other
items that the purchaser claims should have been performed at the plants prior to the transfer. We
intend to recover our receivable through our legal rights to enforce the parental guarantee,
independent of the resolution of the disputed claim. The ultimate resolution of each of these
matters is unknown at this time. During 2007, we recorded an impairment of our investments in
these projects of approximately $15 million as a result of our assessment of these matters and
other unrelated mechanical failures at the plants. Adverse developments related to either our
ability to collect amounts due to us or related to the dispute could require us to record
additional losses in the future.

     Asian and Central American power investments. As of December 31, 2007, our total investment
(including advances to the projects) and guarantees related to these projects was approximately $78
million. We are in the process of selling these assets. Any changes in political and economic
conditions could negatively impact the amount of net proceeds we expect to receive upon their sale,
which may result in additional impairments.

     Investment in Bolivia. We own an 8 percent interest in the Bolivia to Brazil pipeline. As of
December 31, 2007, our total investment and guarantees related to this pipeline project was
approximately $117 million, of which the Bolivian portion was $3 million. In 2006, the Bolivian
government announced a decree significantly increasing its interest in and control over Bolivias
oil and gas assets. We continue to monitor and evaluate, together with our partners, the potential
commercial impact that these political events in Bolivia could have on our investment. As new
information becomes available or future material developments arise, we may be required to record
an impairment of our investment.

     Investment in Argentina. We own an approximate 22 percent interest in the Argentina to Chile
pipeline. As of December 31, 2007, our total investment in this pipeline project was approximately
$21 million. We are currently evaluating opportunities to sell our interest in this pipeline. In
addition, in July 2006, the Ministry of Economy and Production in Argentina issued a decree that
significantly increases the export taxes on natural gas. We continue to evaluate, together with our
partners, the potential commercial impact that this and other decrees could have on the Argentina
to Chile pipeline and the potential value we expect to receive upon the sale of our investment. As
new information becomes available or future material developments arise, we may be required to
record an impairment of our investment.

Costs incurred for Egypt were $10 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

 

(2)
 
Amount includes deferred income tax adjustments of $179 million related to the acquisition of full-cost pool
properties and $217 million related to the acquisition of our unconsolidated investment in Four Star.


     Pursuant to the full cost method of accounting, we capitalize certain general and
administrative expenses related to property acquisition, exploration and development activities and
interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved oil and gas properties and major development
projects of oil and gas properties. The table above includes capitalized internal general and
administrative costs incurred in connection with the acquisition, development and exploration of
natural gas and oil reserves of $69 million, $50 million and $47 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. We also capitalized interest of $35 million, $30 million and $30
million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

     In our January 1, 2008 reserve report, the amounts estimated to be spent in 2008, 2009 and
2010 to develop our consolidated worldwide proved undeveloped reserves are $743 million, $515
million and $170 million.

     Unevaluated Capitalized Costs. We exclude capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties
from amortization that are in various stages of evaluation. We expect a majority of these costs to
be included in the amortization calculation in 2008 and 2009.

     Presented below is an analysis of the capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties by
year of expenditures that are not being amortized as of December 31, 2007, pending determination of
proved reserves (in millions):

Includes capitalized interest of $33 million, $24 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.


     Natural Gas and Oil Reserves. Net quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of
natural gas and NGL, oil and condensate, and changes in these reserves at December 31, 2007
presented in the tables below are based on our internal reserve report. Net proved reserves exclude
royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty
obligations in effect at the time of the estimate. Our consolidated reserves are consistent with
estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies except for differences of less than five
percent resulting from actual production, acquisitions, property sales, necessary reserve revisions
and additions to reflect actual experience.

     Ryder Scott, an independent reservoir engineering firm that reports to the Audit Committee of
our Board of Directors, conducted an audit of the estimates of 84 percent of our consolidated
natural gas and oil reserves. The scope of the audit performed by Ryder Scott included the
preparation of an independent estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves estimates for fields
comprising greater than 80 percent of our total worldwide present value of future cash flows
(pretax). The specific fields included in Ryder Scotts audit represented the largest fields based
on value. Ryder Scott also conducted an audit of the estimates of 75 percent of the proved
reserves of Four Star, our unconsolidated affiliate. Our estimates of Four Stars proved natural
gas and oil reserves are prepared by our internal reservoir engineers and do not reflect those
prepared by the engineers of Four Star. Based on the amount of proved reserves determined by Ryder
Scott, we believe our reported reserve amounts are reasonable. Ryder Scotts reports are included
as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves,
projecting future rates of production and projecting the timing of development expenditures,
including many factors beyond our control. The reserve data represents only estimates. Reservoir
engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil
that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of
the quality of available data and of engineering

137

and geological interpretations and judgment. All estimates of proved reserves are determined according to the rules prescribed by the SEC. These
rules indicate that the standard of reasonable certainty be applied to proved reserve estimates.
This concept of reasonable certainty implies that as more technical data becomes available, a
positive, or upward, revision is more likely than a negative, or downward, revision. Estimates are
subject to revision based upon a number of factors, including reservoir performance, prices,
economic conditions and government restrictions. In addition, results of drilling, testing and
production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of that estimate. Reserve
estimates are often different from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately
recovered.

     The meaningfulness of reserve estimates is highly dependent on the accuracy of the assumptions
on which they were based. In general, the volume of production from natural gas and oil properties
we own declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we conduct successful exploration
and development activities or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, or both,
our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. There have been no major discoveries or
other events, favorable or adverse, that may be considered to have caused a significant change in
the estimated proved reserves since December 31, 2007.

United States excludes $61 million, $219 million and

Table of Contents

     For the calculations in the preceding table, estimated future cash inflows from estimated
future production of proved reserves were computed using year-end prices of $6.80, $5.64, and
$10.08 per MMBtu for natural gas and $95.98, $61.05 and $61.04 per barrel of oil at December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005. In the United States, after adjustments for transportation and other charges,
net prices were $6.40 per Mcf of gas, $87.88 per barrel of oil and $58.63 per barrel of NGL at
December 31, 2007. We may receive amounts different than the standardized measure of discounted
cash flow for a number of reasons, including price changes and the effects of our hedging
activities.

Report
of Management
 
Management is
responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial data presented
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Financial Statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States and include amounts based on managements best estimates
and judgments. Management also is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting for Textron Inc. as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). With the participation of
our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control  Integrated Framework, we have concluded that Textron Inc. maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 29, 2007.
 
The independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Textron Inc. and has issued an attestation report on Textrons
internal controls over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, as
stated in its reports, which are included herein.
 
We conduct our
business in accordance with the standards outlined in the Textron Business Conduct
Guidelines, which are communicated to all employees. Honesty, integrity and
high ethical standards are the core values of how we conduct business. Every
Textron business prepares and carries out an annual Compliance Plan to ensure
these values and standards are maintained. Our internal control structure is
designed to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that assets are
safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The
internal control structure includes, among other things, established policies
and procedures, an internal audit function, and the selection and training of
qualified personnel. Textrons management is responsible for implementing
effective internal control systems and monitoring their effectiveness, as well
as developing and executing an annual internal control plan.
 
The Audit Committee of
our Board of Directors, on behalf of the shareholders, oversees managements
financial reporting responsibilities. The Audit Committee consists of four
directors who are not officers or employees of Textron and meets regularly with
the independent auditors, management and our internal auditors to review
matters relating to financial reporting, internal accounting controls and
auditing. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free and
full access to senior management and the Audit Committee.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
 
The Board of
Directors and Shareholders of Textron Inc.
 
We have audited Textron Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Textron Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
 
A companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
In our opinion,
Textron Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on the COSO
criteria.
 
We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 29, 2007 and December 30,
2006, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Shareholders
Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29,
2007 of Textron Inc. and our report dated February 13, 2008 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Schedule.
 
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Textron Inc.
 
We have audited the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Textron Inc. as of December 29,
2007 and December 30, 2006, and the related Consolidated Statements of
Operations, Shareholders Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 29, 2007. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule contained on page 77. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of Textron Inc.s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the
Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Textron Inc. at December 29,
2007 and December 30, 2006 and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29,
2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.
 
We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Textron Inc.s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 29, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2008 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.
 
As discussed in Note 5
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2007 Textron Inc. adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. 13-2, Accounting
for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income
Taxes Generated by a Leverage Lease Transaction, as discussed in Note 13 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2007 Textron Inc. adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, and as discussed in Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2006 Textron Inc. adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  An amendment of FASB
Statement Nos. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

Textron is segregated into a
  Manufacturing group and a Finance group as described in Note 1 to the
  Consolidated Financial Statements. The Finance groups pre-tax income in
  excess of dividends paid is excluded from the Manufacturing groups cash
  flows. All significant transactions between the borrowing groups have been
  eliminated from the consolidated column.

Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements
 
 
 
Note 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Principles of
Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation
Our Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of Textron Inc. and all of its
majority-owned subsidiaries, along with variable interest entities for which we
are the primary beneficiary.
 
Our financings are
conducted through two separate borrowing groups. The Manufacturing group
consists of Textron Inc., consolidated with the entities that operate in the
Bell, Cessna and Industrial segments, while the Finance group consists of the
Finance segment, comprised of Textron Financial Corporation and its
subsidiaries. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by
separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the
development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our
Finance group provides financial services. Due to the fundamental differences
between each borrowing groups activities, investors, rating agencies and
analysts use different measures to evaluate each groups performance. To
support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information
for each borrowing group within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Through our Finance group, we provide
diversified commercial financing to third parties. In addition, this group
finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment
manufactured by our Manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing.
In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash received from customers or
from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from
third parties. However, in the cash flow information provided for the separate
borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are
reflected based on the operations of each group. For example, when product is
sold by our Manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the Finance
group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing
activities as a cash outflow in the Finance groups statement of cash flows.
Meanwhile, in the Manufacturing groups statement of cash flows, the cash
received from the Finance group on the customers behalf is recorded within
operating cash flows as a cash inflow. Although cash is transferred between the
two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated
cash flows at the time of the original financing. These captive financing
activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are
reclassified or eliminated in consolidation.
 
In July 2007, our Board of Directors
approved a two-for-one split of our common stock. The financial statements for
all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the effect of the
split on share and per share amounts.
 
Use of
Estimates
We prepare our financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items,
long-term contracts, inventory valuation, residual values of leased assets,
allowance for credit losses on receivables, the amount and timing of future
cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans, product liability,
workers compensation, actuarial assumptions for the pension and postretirement
plans, future cash flows associated with goodwill and long-lived asset
valuations, and environmental and warranty reserves. Our estimates are based on
the facts and circumstances available at the time estimates are made,
historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends,
and our assessments of the probable future outcomes of these matters. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are
reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the
statement of operations in the period that they are determined.
 
Cash and Cash
Equivalents
Cash and cash
equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less.
 
Revenue
Recognition
We generally recognize revenue from the sale of
our products that are not under long-term contracts upon delivery. For
commercial aircraft, delivery is upon completion of manufacturing, customer
acceptance, and the transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership.
 
When a sale arrangement involves multiple
elements, such as sales of products that include customization and other
services, we evaluate the arrangement to determine whether there are separate
items that are required to be delivered under the arrangement that qualify as
separate units of accounting. The total fee from the arrangement is then
allocated to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value, taking
into consideration any performance, cancellation, termination or refund-type
provisions. Fair value generally is established for each unit of accounting
using the sales price charged when the same or similar items are sold
separately. We recognize revenue when the recognition criteria for each unit of
accounting are met.
 
43


 
Leases  Certain qualifying noncancelable aircraft
and other product lease contracts are accounted for as sales-type leases. Upon
delivery, we record the present value of all payments (net of executory costs
and any guaranteed residual values) under these leases as revenues, and the
related costs of the product are charged to cost of sales. For lease financing
transactions that do not qualify as sales-type leases, we record revenue as
earned over the lease period.
 
Long-Term
Contracts  Revenues
under long-term contracts are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position No. 81-1, Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. Under the
percentage-of-completion method, we estimate profit as the difference between
the total estimated revenue and cost of a contract. We then recognize that
estimated profit over the contract term based on either the costs incurred
(under the cost-to-cost method, which is typically used for development effort)
or the units delivered (under the units-of-delivery method, which is used for
production effort), as appropriate under the circumstances. Revenues under all
cost-reimbursement contracts are recorded using the cost-to-cost method.
Revenues under fixed-price contracts generally are recorded using the
units-of-delivery method; however, when the contracts provide for periodic
delivery after a lengthy period of time over which significant costs are
incurred or require a significant amount of development effort in relation to
total contract volume, revenues are recorded using the cost-to-cost method.
 
Our long-term contract profits are based on
estimates of total contract cost and revenue utilizing current contract
specifications, expected engineering requirements and the achievement of
contract milestones, including product deliveries. Certain contracts are
awarded with fixed-price incentive fees that also are considered when
estimating revenues and profit rates. Contract costs typically are incurred
over a period of several years, and the estimation of these costs requires
substantial judgment. We review and revise these estimates periodically
throughout the contract term. Revisions to contract profits are recorded when
the revisions to estimated revenues or costs are made. Anticipated losses on
contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become
probable and estimable.
 
Our Bell Helicopter
business has a joint venture with The Boeing Company (Boeing) to provide engineering,
development and test services related to the V-22 aircraft, as well as to
produce the V-22 aircraft, under a number of separate contracts with the U.S.
Government (the V-22 Contracts). This joint venture agreement creates
contractual, rather than ownership, rights related to the V-22.
Accordingly, we do not account for this joint venture under the equity method
of accounting. We account for all of our rights and obligations under the
specific requirements of the V-22 Contracts allocated to us under the joint
venture agreement. Revenues and cost of sales reflect our performance under the
V-22 Contracts with revenue on production lots, beginning with the seventh lot,
recognized using the units-of-delivery method. We include all assets used in performance
of the V-22 Contracts that we own, including inventory and unpaid receivables,
and all liabilities arising from our obligations under the V-22 Contracts in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
Finance
Revenues  Finance
revenues include interest on finance receivables, direct loan origination costs
and fees received. We recognize interest using the interest method to provide a
constant rate of return over the terms of the receivables. Revenues on direct
loan origination costs and fees received are deferred and amortized to finance
revenues over the contractual lives of the respective receivables using the
interest method. When receivables are sold or prepaid, unamortized amounts are
recognized in finance revenues. We generally suspend the accrual of interest
income for accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than three
months. In addition, detailed reviews of loans may result in earlier
suspension. We resume the accrual of interest when the loan becomes
contractually current and recognize the suspended interest income at that time.
Cash payments on nonaccrual accounts, including finance charges, generally are
applied to reduce loan principal.
 
Losses on
Finance Receivables
Provisions for losses
on finance receivables are charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain
the allowance at a level considered adequate to cover losses in the existing
receivable portfolio. We evaluate the allowance by examining current
delinquencies, characteristics of the existing accounts, historical loss experience,
underlying collateral value, and general economic conditions and trends. In
addition, for larger balance commercial loans, we consider borrower specific
information, industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows. Finance
receivables generally are written down to the fair value (less estimated costs
to sell) of the related collateral at the earlier of the date when the
collateral is repossessed or when no payment has been received for six months.
Finance receivables are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible.
 
Loan
Impairment
We periodically evaluate our non-homogeneous
loan portfolios for impairment. A loan is considered impaired when it is
probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement. We also identify loans that are
considered impaired due to the significant modification of the original loan
terms. These modified loans reflect deferred principal payments, generally at
market interest rates, and continue to accrue finance charges since collection
of principal and interest is not doubtful. We measure impairment by
 
44


 
comparing the fair value of a loan with its
carrying amount. Fair value is based on the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans
observable market price or, if the loan is collateral dependent, at the fair
value of the collateral, less selling costs. If the fair value of the loan is
less than its carrying amount, we establish a reserve based on this difference.
 
Securitized
Transactions
Securitized transactions involve the sale of
finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts. Through our Finance
group, we sell or securitize loans and leases and may retain an interest in the
assets sold in the form of interest-only securities, seller certificates, cash
reserve accounts, and servicing rights and obligations. These retained
interests are subordinate to other investors interests in the securitizations.
We do not provide legal recourse to third-party investors that purchase
interests in our securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the
retained interest-only securities, seller certificates and cash reserve
accounts. Gain or loss on the sale of the loans or leases depends, in part, on
the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer,
which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on
their relative fair values at the date of transfer.
 
Retained interests are
recorded at fair value in other assets. We estimate fair values based on the
present value of expected future cash flows using managements best estimates
of key assumptions  credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved. We review the fair values of the retained
interests quarterly using updated assumptions and compare such amounts with the
carrying value of the retained interests. When the carrying value exceeds the
fair value of the retained interests, we determine whether the decline in fair
value is other than temporary. When we determine that the value of the decline
is other than temporary, we write down the retained interests to fair value
with a corresponding charge to income. When a change in fair value of retained
interests is deemed temporary, we record a corresponding credit or charge to
other comprehensive income for any unrealized gains or losses.
 
Investments
We classify investments
in marketable equity securities as available for sale and record these
investments at fair value in other assets. Unrealized gains and losses related
to these investments are included in shareholders equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss. Investments in non-marketable equity
securities are accounted for under either the cost or equity method of
accounting. For investments in joint ventures for which we do not have control
or are not the primary beneficiary but where we do have the ability to exercise
significant influence over the ventures operating and financial policies, we
use the equity method.
 
Inventories
Inventories are stated
at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. We value our
inventories generally using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying inventories in the
U.S. We determine costs for our commercial helicopters on an average cost basis
by model considering the expended and estimated costs for the current
production release. Costs on long-term contracts represent costs incurred for
production, allocable operating overhead, advances to suppliers, and, in the
case of contracts with the U.S. Government, allocable research and development
and general and administrative expenses. Since our inventoried costs include
amounts related to contracts with long production cycles, a portion of these
costs is not expected to be realized within one year. Pursuant to contract
provisions, agencies of the U.S. Government have title to, or security interest
in, inventories related to such contracts as a result of advances,
performance-based payments and progress payments. Such advances and payments
are reflected as an offset against the related inventory balances.
 
Customer deposits are
recorded against inventory when the right of offset exists. All other customer
deposits are recorded in accrued liabilities.
 
Property,
Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost and are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method. Land
improvements and buildings are depreciated primarily over estimated lives
ranging from four to 40 years, while machinery and equipment are depreciated
primarily over one to 15 years. We capitalize expenditures for improvements
that increase asset values and extend useful lives.
 
Intangible and
Other Long-Lived Assets
At acquisition, we estimate and record the
fair value of purchased intangible assets primarily using discounted cash flow
analysis of anticipated cash flows reflecting incremental revenues and/or cost
savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset, reflecting market
participant assumptions. Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is
recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that
reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets
are consumed or otherwise realized. Approximately 40% of our gross intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method, with the
remaining assets, primarily customer agreements, amortized based on the cash
flow streams used to value the asset.
 
45


 
Long-lived assets,
including intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of
the asset held for use exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash
flows, the carrying value of the asset is generally written down to fair value.
Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value
less cost to sell. Fair value is determined using pertinent market information,
including estimated future discounted cash flows.
 
Goodwill
We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as
declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the
business climate, indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be
impaired. The reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete
financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for
businesses one level below that operating segment (a component), in which
case such component is the reporting unit. In certain instances, we have
aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit
based on similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is considered to be
potentially impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its
estimated fair value. Fair values are established primarily using a discounted
cash flow methodology. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on
the businesses strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. When
available, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate discounted cash
flow results.
 
Pension and
Postretirement Benefit Obligations
We maintain various
pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. These plans
include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are
calculated based on actuarial valuations. Key assumptions used in determining
these obligations and related expenses include expected long-term rates of
return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. We
evaluate and update these assumptions annually in consultation with third-party
actuaries and investment advisors. We also make assumptions regarding employee
demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the
rate of compensation increases.
 
We adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - An amendment of
FASB Statement Nos. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) on December 30, 2006. In
accordance with this Statement, we recognize the overfunded or underfunded
status of our pension and postretirement plans on the balance sheet and
recognize changes in the funded status of our defined benefit plans in comprehensive
income in the year in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses that are not
immediately recognized as net periodic pension cost are recognized as a
component of other comprehensive loss and amortized into net periodic pension
cost in future periods.
 
At December 30, 2006, the impact of
implementing SFAS No. 158 reduced total assets by $313 million, increased
total liabilities by $334 million and reduced shareholders equity (increase to
accumulated other comprehensive loss) by $647 million, net of tax. In addition,
we classified $92 million of pension and postretirement benefit liabilities as
current. The adoption did not affect our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption represents the
net unrecognized actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs (credits)
and unrecognized transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of
SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, all of which were
previously netted against the plans funded status in our balance sheet
pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 87. These amounts will be
subsequently amortized into net periodic pension cost in future periods.
 
Derivative
Financial Instruments
We are exposed to market risk primarily from
changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and securities pricing. We
do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. To manage the volatility relating to our exposures, we
net these exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural
offsets. For the residual portion, we enter into various derivative
transactions pursuant to our policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and hedging practices. All derivative instruments are reported on the balance
sheets at fair value. Designation to support hedge accounting is performed on a
specific exposure basis. For financial instruments qualifying as fair value
hedges, we record changes in fair value in income, offset, in part or in whole,
by corresponding changes in the fair value of the underlying exposures being
hedged. For cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of
derivatives (to the extent they are effective as hedges) in other comprehensive
(loss) income, net of deferred taxes. Changes in fair value of derivatives not
qualifying as hedges are recorded in income.
 
Foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars. Adjustments from currency rate
changes are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account in
shareholders equity until the related foreign entity is sold or substantially
liquidated. We use foreign currency financing transactions, including currency
swaps, to effectively hedge long-term investments in foreign operations with
the same corresponding currency. Foreign currency gains and losses on the hedge
of the long term investments are recorded in the cumulative translation
adjustment account with the offset recorded as an adjustment to the non-U.S.
dollar financing liability.
 
46


 
Fair Values of
Financial Instruments
The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, and variable-rate receivables and debt
approximates the carrying value of these financial instruments. We determine
the estimated fair values of other financial instruments, including debt,
equity and risk management instruments, using available market information and
valuation methodologies, primarily discounted cash flow analysis or independent
investment bankers.
 
Product and
Environmental Liabilities
We accrue product liability claims and related
defense costs on the occurrence method when a loss is probable and reasonably
estimable based on historical experience and the insurance coverage and
deductibles in effect at the date of the incident.
 
Liabilities for
environmental matters are recorded on a site-by-site basis when it is probable
that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated.
We estimate our accrued environmental liabilities using currently available
facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, which
all are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties. Our environmental
liabilities are undiscounted and do not take into consideration possible future
insurance proceeds or significant amounts from claims against other third
parties.
 
Research and
Development Costs
Research and development costs that are either
not specifically covered by contracts or represent our share under cost-sharing
arrangements are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs
incurred under contracts with others are reported as cost of sales over the
period that revenue is recognized.
 
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates
expected to be in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will
reverse or settle. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognize
future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent
that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits.
We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
income tax expense. We periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able
to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in
the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other
comprehensive income (loss), as appropriate. In assessing the need for a
valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable
temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years, the feasibility of
tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income.
 
Recently
Announced Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements.
SFAS No.157 replaces multiple existing definitions of fair value with a single
definition, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and
expands financial statement disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This
Statement applies only to fair value measurements that already are required or
permitted by other accounting standards and does not require any new fair value
measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective in the first quarter of 2008, and
we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.
 
In February 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115.
SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible assets and
liabilities at fair value with changes in value recognized in earnings. Fair
value treatment may be elected either upon initial recognition of an eligible
asset or liability or, for an existing asset or liability, if an event triggers
a new basis of accounting. SFAS No. 159 is effective in the first quarter
of 2008. We do not expect to elect to re-measure any of our existing financial
assets or liabilities under its provisions.
 
Note
2. Discontinued Operations
 
In August 2006, we completed the sale of our
Fastening Systems business to Platinum Equity, a private equity investment
firm, for approximately $613 million in cash and the assumption of $16 million
of net indebtedness and certain liabilities. There was no gain or loss recorded
upon completion of the sale. Prior to the consummation of the sale of the
Fastening Systems business, we recorded impairment and other charges of $120
million in 2006 and $387 million in 2005, which are described below. The
results of this business were accounted for as discontinued operations in the
Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented herein.
 
47


 
In September 2005,
our Board of Directors approved managements recommendation to explore
strategic alternatives for the Fastening Systems business. Based on the
approval of this recommendation and the likelihood of execution, we determined
that an impairment indicator existed for both the Fastening Systems goodwill
and its long-lived assets. In our assessment of potential impairment of the
goodwill, we estimated the fair value of the business based on current market
data. This fair value amount then was compared with the carrying amount of the
business. As the carrying amount exceeded the fair value, we then measured the
amount of goodwill impairment loss. The excess of the fair value of the
business over the fair value amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities
represents the implied fair value of goodwill. The carrying amount of the
goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill, resulting in an
impairment loss of $335 million in 2005.
 
Our Board of Directors
authorized the divestiture of the Fastening Systems business in December 2005,
and we recorded an after-tax charge of approximately $52 million. This charge
included $37 million related to previously deferred foreign currency
translation losses and $7 million in curtailment losses for employee retirement
plans. After these charges, we assessed the estimated fair value of the
business and determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value was
required at that time. In the second quarter of 2006, we recorded an additional
$120 million after-tax impairment charge to record the business at the
estimated fair value less cost to sell at that time based on offers received
from potential purchasers.
 
Operating results for
our discontinued businesses, primarily related to Fastening Systems, are as
follows:

Gain on disposal, net
of income taxes is primarily related to a tax benefit recorded with the sale of
the InteSys business in 2005.
 
We generally use a
centralized approach to the cash management and financing of our manufacturing
operations and, accordingly, do not allocate debt or interest expense to our
discontinued businesses. Any debt and related interest expense of a specific
entity within a business is recorded by the respective entity. General
corporate overhead previously allocated to the businesses for reporting
purposes is excluded from amounts reported as discontinued operations.
 
At December 29, 2007, assets and
liabilities of discontinued operations primarily relate to the sale of the
Fastening Systems business. For 2007, cash flows provided by operating and
investing activities are primarily related to taxes.

3. Business Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 
2007 Business
Acquisitions
In 2007, we acquired
four businesses for cash totaling $1.1 billion. The results of operations for
these acquired businesses have been included in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations since the dates of each respective acquisition. Pro forma
information has not been included as the amounts are immaterial.
 
On November 14, 2007, we acquired a
majority ownership interest in United Industrial Corporation (UIC), a
publicly held company (NYSE: UIC), pursuant to a cash tender offer for $81 per
share. UIC operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, AAI Corporation (AAI).
AAI is a leading provider of intelligent aerospace and defense systems,
including unmanned aircraft and ground control stations, aircraft and satellite
test equipment, training systems and countersniper devices. UIC has been
integrated into our Bell segment, where we believe it adds important
capabilities to our existing aerospace and defense businesses and advances our
strategy to deliver broader and more integrated solutions to our customers. In
December, we completed the acquisition and obtained 100% ownership of UIC.
 
48


 
The following table
summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
from UIC as of November 14, 2007, the effective date of the acquisition:

In addition to the $655
million we paid for the net assets acquired on November 14, 2007, we paid
approximately $240 million to settle outstanding acquired debt and other
obligations and $157 million to purchase the minority interest in December.
 
The acquired intangible
assets represent primarily customer agreements and contractual relationships
with a weighted-average useful life of 13 years. We have allocated the purchase
price of this business to the estimated fair value of the net tangible and
intangible assets acquired, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Approximately
$64 million of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. These estimates are
preliminary as of the end of 2007 as we are awaiting the completion of the
identification and valuation of the intangible assets acquired. We expect these
analyses will be completed during the first half of 2008.
 
In 2007, we also acquired certain assets of
CAV-Air LLC, Columbia Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation and Paladin Tools.
CAV-Airs helicopter maintenance and service center was acquired by our Bell
segment. Columbia Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation produces high-performance,
single engine aircraft and has been integrated into our Cessna segment. Paladin
Tools is a provider of tools and accessories for the telecommunications
industry and has been integrated into our Industrial segment. We have recorded
$12 million of goodwill and $16 million in intangibles for these businesses.
 
2006 Business
Acquisitions
We acquired three businesses in 2006 for a total
cost of $338 million in the Bell segment and $164 million in the Finance
segment, all of which were paid for in cash. The operating results of these
businesses have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since
the date of each respective acquisition. These acquisitions include the
following:
 
·                  Overwatch
Systems (Overwatch), a developer and provider of intelligence analysis
software tools for the defense industry, was acquired on December 1.
·                  Innovative
Survivability Technologies, Inc., a supplier of innovative defensive
systems to military and homeland security customers, was acquired on July 19.
·                  Electrolux
Financial Corporations dealer inventory finance business, which provides
consumer appliance and electronics dealers with wholesale inventory financing,
was acquired on June 30.
 
In connection with these acquisitions in 2006,
we recorded $259 million in goodwill and $112 million in identifiable
intangible assets, primarily in the Bell segment. These amounts were adjusted
in 2007 to reflect the final fair value adjustments, which resulted in a reduction
of goodwill of $14 million, net of deferred taxes, and an increase in
intangible assets of $21 million. The adjusted intangible assets and
weighted-average amortization periods are as follows: $84 million in patents
and technology (15 years), $33 million in customer agreements (9 years) and $16
million in other intangible assets (4 years).

The above table does not
necessarily reflect future cash collections, as receivables often are repaid or
refinanced prior to contractual maturity.
 
Revolving
loans and distribution finance receivables generally mature within one to five
years. Revolving loans are secured by trade receivables, inventory, plant and
equipment, pools of vacation interval notes receivables, pools of residential
and recreational land loans, and the underlying property. Distribution finance
receivables generally are secured by the inventory of the financed distributor
and include floorplan financing for third-party dealers for inventory sold by
the E-Z-GO and Jacobsen businesses.
 
Installment
contracts and finance leases have initial terms ranging from two to 20 years
and primarily are secured by the financed equipment. Installment contracts
generally require the customer to pay a significant down payment, along with
periodic scheduled principal payments that reduce the outstanding balance
through the term of the loan. Finance leases include residual values expected
to be realized at contractual maturity. Leases with no significant residual
value at the end of the contractual term are classified as installment
contracts, as their legal and economic substance is more equivalent to a
secured borrowing than a finance lease with a significant residual value.
Contractual maturities for finance leases classified as installment contracts
in the table above represent the minimum lease payments, net of the unearned
income to be recognized over the life of the lease. Total minimum lease
payments and unearned income related to these contracts were $1.0 billion and
$315 million, respectively, at December 29, 2007 and $719 million and $222
million, respectively, at December 30, 2006. Minimum lease payments due
under these contracts for each of the next five years are as follows: $173
million in 2008, $149 million in 2009, $132 million in 2010, $141 million in
2011 and $106 million in 2012. Minimum lease payments due under finance leases
for each of the next five years are as follows: $156 million in 2008, $113
million in 2009, $75 million in 2010, $46 million in 2011 and $8 million in
2012.
 
Golf course and resort
mortgages are secured by real property and generally are limited to 75% or less
of the propertys appraised market value at loan origination. Golf course
mortgages have initial terms ranging from five to 10 years with amortization
periods from 15 to 25 years. Golf course mortgages, totaling $1.1 billion,
consist of loans with an average balance of $5 million and a weighted-average
remaining contractual maturity of five years. Resort mortgages generally
represent construction and inventory loans with terms up to five years.
 
Leveraged
leases are secured by the ownership of the leased equipment and real property
and have initial terms up to approximately 30 years. Leveraged leases reflect
contractual maturities net of contractual nonrecourse debt payments and include
residual values expected to be realized at contractual maturity.

In the first quarter of 2007,
we adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 13-2, Accounting for a Change
or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes
Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction (FSP 13-2). FSP 13-2 requires a
recalculation of returns on leveraged leases if there is a change or projected
change in the timing of cash flows related to income taxes generated by the
leveraged leases. The impact of any estimated change in projected cash flows
must be reported as an adjustment to the net leveraged lease investment and
retained earnings at the date of adoption. Our Finance group has leveraged
leases with an initial investment balance of $209 million that we estimate
could be impacted by changes in the timing of cash flows related to income
taxes. Upon the adoption, we reduced retained earnings for the $33 million
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and reduced our
investment in these leveraged leases by $50 million and deferred income tax
liabilities by $17 million.
 
Our Finance group manages and
services finance receivables for a variety of investors, participants and
third-party portfolio owners. The total managed and serviced finance receivable
portfolio, including owned finance receivables, was $12.5 billion at the end of
2007 and $11.5 billion at the end of 2006. Managed receivables include owned
finance receivables and finance receivables sold in securitizations and private
transactions where we retain some element of credit risk and continue to
service the portfolio.
 
Our finance receivables are
diversified across geographic region, borrower industry and type of collateral.
At December 29, 2007, 78% of our finance receivables were distributed
throughout the United States, compared with 83% at the end of 2006. The most
significant collateral concentration was in general aviation, which accounted
for 22% of managed receivables at the end of 2007 and 19% at the end of 2006.
Industry concentrations in the golf and vacation interval industries accounted
for 15% and 13%, respectively, of managed receivables at December 29,
2007, compared with 16% and 13%, respectively, at the end of 2006.
 
Transactions
between Finance and Manufacturing Groups
 
A portion of our Finance
groups business involves financing retail purchases and leases for new and
used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our Manufacturing group. The
captive finance receivables for these inventory sales that are included in our
Finance groups balance sheets are summarized below:

Operating agreements specify
that our Finance group has recourse to our Manufacturing group for certain
uncollected amounts related to these transactions. Our Manufacturing group has
established reserves for losses on its balance sheet within accrued and other
liabilities for the receivables it guarantees. These reserves are established
for amounts that potentially are uncollectible or if the collateral values are
considered insufficient to cover the outstanding receivable. If an account is
deemed uncollectible and the collateral is repossessed by our Finance group,
our Manufacturing group is charged for the deficiency. If the collateral is not
repossessed, the receivable is transferred from the Finance groups balance sheet
to the Manufacturing groups balance sheet. The Manufacturing group then is
responsible for any additional collection efforts. When this occurs, any
related reserve previously established by the Manufacturing group is
reclassified from accrued or other liabilities and netted against the
receivable or asset transferred from the Finance group.
 
In 2007, 2006 and 2005, our
Finance group paid the Manufacturing group $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $0.8
billion, respectively, related to the sale of Textron-manufactured products
that were financed by the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group also received
proceeds in those years of $27 million, $63 million and $41 million,
respectively, from the sale of equipment to the Finance group for use under
operating lease agreements. At the end of 2007 and 2006, the amounts guaranteed
by the Manufacturing group totaled $254 million and $335 million, respectively.
The Manufacturing group has total reserves for losses on these of $22 million
at the end of 2007 and $39 million at the end of 2006.
 
Impairment
 
Nonaccrual finance
receivables include accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than
three months for which the accrual of interest income is suspended. These
receivables are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable
to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement. Impaired accrual finance receivables represent loans with original
loan terms that have been significantly modified to reflect deferred principal
payments, generally at market interest rates, for which collection of principal
and interest is not doubtful. Past due loans for which the Finance group has
recourse to the Manufacturing group are not considered impaired in the table
below; these loans totaled $3 million and $2 million at the end of 2007 and
2006, respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired finance
receivables during 2007 was $84 million, compared with $142 million in 2006.
The impaired finance receivables and related reserves at the end of 2007 and
2006 are as follows:

Securitizations
 
Our Finance group sells
primarily its distribution finance receivables and general aviation loans to
qualified special purpose trusts through securitization transactions.
Distribution finance receivables represent loans secured by dealer inventories
that typically are collected upon the sale of the underlying product. Through a
revolving securitization, the proceeds from collection of the principal balance
of these loans are used by the trust to purchase additional distribution
finance receivables from us each month. This revolving securitization accounted
for approximately 93% of our securitization gains in 2007.
 
We
received proceeds from securitizations of $731 million in 2007, $50 million in
2006 and $361 million in 2005. For the revolving securitization, these proceeds
include only amounts received related to incremental increases in the level of
receivables sold into the securitization. Gains from securitizations were
approximately $62 million in 2007, $42 million in 2006 and $49 million in 2005.
At the end of 2007, $2.5 billion in securitized loans were outstanding, with
$17 million in past-due loans.
 
Generally,
we retain an interest in the assets sold in the form of servicing
responsibilities and subordinated interests, including interest-only
securities, seller certificates and cash reserves. At the end of 2007, we had
$203 million in retained interest recorded in other assets, which
 
53


 
included
$152 million in distribution finance receivables and $41 million in general
aviation loans. In comparison, retained interest totaled $179 million at the
end of 2006. Cash flows received on these retained interests totaled $71
million in 2007, $63 million in 2006 and $64 million in 2005. Key economic

respectively. Had our LIFO inventories been valued at current costs, their
carrying values would have been approximately $307 million and $276 million
higher at those respective dates. Inventories related to long-term contracts,
net of progress/milestone payments, were $710 million at the end of 2007 and
$380 million at the end of 2006.

We have incurred asset
retirement obligations primarily related to costs to remove and dispose of
underground storage tanks and asbestos materials used in insulation, adhesive
fillers and floor tiles. There is no legal requirement to remove these items,
and there currently is no plan to remodel the related facilities or otherwise
cause the impacted items to require disposal. As a result, these asset
retirement obligations are not estimable, and, in accordance with the
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, we have not recorded a liability.

** At the
end of 2007 and 2006, variable-rate notes totaled $2.5 billion and $1.8

In 2007, the Finance group
issued $300 million of 6% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes,
which are unsecured and rank junior to all of its existing and future senior
debt. The notes mature on February 15, 2067; however, we have the right to
redeem the notes at par on or after February 15, 2017 and are obligated to
redeem the notes beginning on February 15, 2042. The Finance group has
agreed in a replacement capital covenant that it will not redeem the notes on
or before February 15, 2047 unless it receives a capital contribution from
the Manufacturing group and/or net proceeds from the sale of certain replacement
capital securities at specified amounts. Interest on the notes is fixed at 6%
until February 15, 2017 and floats at the three-month London Interbank
Offered Rate + 1.735% thereafter.
 
We have a policy of
maintaining unused committed bank lines of credit in an amount not less than
outstanding commercial paper balances. These facilities are in support of
commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only, and neither of these
primary lines of credit was drawn at December 29, 2007 or December 30,
2006. Our Manufacturing group had no commercial paper outstanding at December 29,
2007 or December 30, 2006 and had a weighted-average interest rate on its

Note 9.
Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments
 
Fair Value
Interest Rate Hedges
 
We manage interest cost for
our Manufacturing group using a mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. To manage
this mix in a cost-efficient manner, we periodically enter into interest rate
exchange agreements to swap, at specified intervals, the difference between
fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon
notional principal amount. Generally, these hedges are considered perfectly
effective since the critical terms of the debt and the interest rate exchange
match and the other conditions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, are met. The mark-to-market values of both
the fair value hedge instruments and underlying debt obligations are recorded
as equal and offsetting amounts in interest expense. In December 2007, our
Manufacturing group terminated all outstanding interest rate exchange
agreements with a fair value liability of $2 million. The mark-to-market adjustment
to the carrying value of the underlying debt instrument will be amortized over
the remaining life. These agreements had a fair value liability of $8 million
at the end of 2006.
 
Our
Finance group enters into interest rate exchange agreements to mitigate
exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate receivables and debt
due to fluctuations in interest rates. By using these agreements, we are able
to convert our fixed-rate cash flows to floating-rate cash flows. At December 29,
2007, the Finance group had interest rate exchange agreements with a fair value
asset of $18 million designated as fair value hedges, compared with a $45
million liability at December 30, 2006.
 
56


 
Cash Flow
Interest Rate Hedges
 
We experience variability in
the cash flows we receive from our Finance groups investments in interest-only
securities due to fluctuations in interest rates. To mitigate our exposure to
this variability, our Finance group enters into interest rate exchange, cap and
floor agreements. The combination of these instruments converts net residual
floating-rate cash flows expected to be received by our Finance group to
fixed-rate cash flows. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are
recorded net of the income tax effect in other comprehensive income (loss). At December 29,
2007 and December 30, 2006, these instruments had an insignificant value.
We do not expect a significant amount of deferred gains, net of tax to be
reclassified to earnings related to these hedge relationships in 2008.
 
For
cash flow hedges, our Finance group recorded an after-tax loss of $3 million in
2007, an after-tax gain of $1 million in 2006 and an after-tax loss of $5
million in 2005 to accumulated other comprehensive loss with no impact to the
statements of operations. We have not incurred a significant net gain or loss
in earnings as the result of the ineffectiveness, or the exclusion of any
component from our assessment of hedge effectiveness, in 2007 or 2006.
 
Our exposure to loss from
nonperformance by the counterparties to our interest rate exchange agreements
at the end of 2007 is minimal. We do not anticipate nonperformance by
counterparties in the periodic settlements of amounts due. We currently
minimize this potential for risk by entering into contracts exclusively with
major, financially sound counterparties having no less than a long-term bond
rating of A, by continuously monitoring such credit ratings and by limiting
exposure to any one financial institution. The credit risk generally is limited
to the amount by which the counterparties contractual obligations exceed our
obligations to the counterparty.
 
Cash Flow
Foreign Exchange Rate Hedges
 
Since we manufacture and
sell our products in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed
to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary purpose of our
foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the volatility associated with
foreign currency purchases of materials, foreign currency sales of products,
and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We
primarily utilize forward exchange contracts and purchased options with
maturities of no more than 18 months that qualify as cash flow hedges. These
are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted
sales, inventory purchases and overhead expenses. The fair value of these
instruments was a $40 million and $13 million asset at the end of 2007 and
2006, respectively. At year-end 2007, $34 million in after-tax income was
reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss from qualifying cash flow
hedges. This income generally is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the
next 18 months as the underlying transactions occur.
 
Our Manufacturing group also
enters into certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not meet
hedge accounting criteria and primarily are intended to protect against
exposure related to intercompany financing transactions. The fair value of
these instruments at the end of 2007 and 2006 and the net impact of the related
gains and losses on selling and administrative expense in 2007 and 2006 were
not material.
 
Net
Investment Hedging
 
We
hedge our net investment position in major currencies and generate foreign
currency interest payments that offset other transactional exposures in these
currencies. To accomplish this, we borrow directly in foreign currency and
designate a portion of foreign currency debt as a hedge of net investments. We
also may utilize currency forwards as hedges of our related foreign net
investments. Currency effects of these hedges, which are reflected in the
cumulative translation adjustment account within other comprehensive income
(loss), produced a $24 million after-tax loss during 2007, leaving an
accumulated net loss balance of $43 million.
 
Stock-Based
Compensation Hedging
 
We
manage the expense related to stock-based compensation awards using cash
settlement forward contracts on our common stock. The use of these forward
contracts modifies compensation expense exposure to changes in the stock price
with the intent to reduce potential variability. The fair value of these
instruments at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 was a
receivable of $62 million and $24 million, respectively. Gains and losses on
these instruments are recorded as an adjustment to compensation expense when
the award is charged to expense. These contracts increased net income by $53
million in 2007, $21 million in 2006 and $8 million in 2005. Cash received or paid
on the contract settlement is included in cash flows from operating activities,
consistent with the classification of the cash flows on the underlying hedged
compensation expense.

Shareholders Equity
 
Capital
Stock
 
We
have authorization for 15 million shares of preferred stock with no par value
and 500 million shares of $0.125 par value common stock. Each share of $2.08
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A ($23.63 approximate
stated value; $11.00 liquidation value) is convertible into 8.8 shares of
common stock, and we can redeem it for $50 per share. At the end of 2007, 2006
and 2005, we had approximately 72,000; 147,000 and 153,000 shares,
respectively, of $2.08 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A
issued with approximately 72,000; 78,000 and 84,000 shares outstanding. Each
share of $1.40 Convertible Preferred Dividend Stock, Series B ($11.82
approximate stated value, preferred only as to dividends) is convertible into
7.2 shares of common stock, and we can redeem it for $45 per share. At the end
of 2007, 2006 and 2005, we had approximately 36,000; 527,000 and 534,000
shares, respectively, of $1.40 Convertible Preferred Dividend Stock, Series B
issued with approximately 36,000; 41,000 and 47,000 shares outstanding.
 
On July 18, 2007, our
Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our common stock effected in
the form of a 100% stock dividend and the retirement of 85 million shares of
treasury stock. The additional shares resulting from the stock split were
distributed on August 24, 2007 to shareholders of record on August 3,
2007. Prior period share data and per share data has been restated to reflect
this stock split.

Note 11.
Share-Based Compensation
 
Our 2007 Long-Term Incentive
Plan (the Plan) supersedes the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan and authorizes
awards to our key employees in the form of options to purchase our shares,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance stock awards and other awards. Options granted to purchase our
shares have a maximum term of 10 years and vest ratably over a three-year
period. Restricted stock unit awards granted vest one-third each in the third,
fourth and fifth year following the grant. A maximum of 12 million shares is
authorized for issuance for all purposes under the Plan, plus any shares that
become available upon cancellation, forfeiture or expiration of awards granted
under the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan. No more than 12 million shares may be
awarded pursuant to incentive stock options, and no more than 3 million shares
may be awarded pursuant to restricted stock or other full value awards
intended to be paid in shares. The Plan also authorizes performance share units
paid in cash. Payouts under performance share units vary based on certain
performance criteria measured over a three-year period. The performance share
units vest at the end of three years. We also provide share-based compensation
awards payable in cash, including retention awards to certain executives and
restricted stock units.
 
Through our Deferred Income
Plan for Textron Key Executives (the DIP), we provide participants the
opportunity to voluntarily defer up to 25% of their base salary and up to 100%
of annual and long-term incentive compensation and other compensation. Elective
deferrals may be put into either a stock unit account or an interest bearing
account. We generally contribute a 10% premium on amounts deferred into the stock
unit account. Executives who are eligible to participate in the DIP who have
not achieved and/or maintained the required minimum stock ownership level are
required to defer annual incentive compensation in excess of 100% of the
executives annual target into a deferred stock unit account and are not
entitled to the 10% premium contribution on the amount deferred. Participants
cannot move amounts between the two accounts while actively employed by us and
cannot receive distributions until termination of employment.

We adopted SFAS No. 123
(Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123-R), which replaces
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, in the first
quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123-R
requires companies to measure compensation costs for share-based payments to
employees, including stock options, at fair value and to expense such
compensation over the service period. Under the transition method, compensation
expense recognized in 2005 includes: a) compensation cost for all stock options
and restricted stock granted units payable in shares prior to but not yet
vested as of January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated
and recognized in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and b)
compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock units payable in
shares granted subsequent to January 1, 2005 and all share-based
compensation awards accounted for as liabilities, based upon the measurement
and recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123-R. For awards granted or
modified in 2005 and prospectively, compensation costs for awards with only
service conditions that vest ratably are recognized on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the
award. Compensation costs for awards granted prior to 2005 are recognized using
the attribution methods required under SFAS No. 123.

Share-based compensation
costs are reflected primarily in selling and administrative expenses.
Compensation expense includes approximately $23 million, $16 million and $17
million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing the attribution of
the fair value of options issued and the portion of previously granted options
for which the requisite service has been rendered. During 2006, we recorded
approximately $4 million of share-based award forfeitures related to
discontinued operations.
 
Stock
Options
 
The stock option
compensation cost calculated under the fair value approach is recognized over
the vesting period of the stock options. The weighted-average fair value of
options granted per share was $14, $12 and $10 for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. We estimate the fair value of options granted on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatilities are
based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock,
historical volatilities and other factors. We use historical data to estimate
option exercise behavior, adjusted to reflect anticipated increases in expected
life.
 
The
weighted-average assumptions used in our Black-Scholes option-pricing model for
awards issued during the respective periods are as follows:

and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 4.8 years at December 29,
2007.
 
Restricted
Stock Units
The fair value of a restricted stock unit paid
in stock is based on the trading price of our common stock on the date of
grant, less required adjustments to reflect the fair value of the award as
dividends are not paid or accrued until the restricted stock unit vests. The
weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock units paid in stock
that were granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $45, $41 and $36 per
share, respectively.

As of December 29,

with unvested awards subject only to service conditions. As of December 29,
2007, we had not recognized $35 million of total compensation cost associated
with unvested share-based compensation awards subject to performance vesting
conditions. We expect to recognize compensation expense for each of these types
of awards over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.
 
The fair value of share-based
compensation awards accounted for as liabilities includes performance share
units, retention awards, restricted stock units payable in cash and DIP stock
unit awards. The fair value of these awards is based on the trading price of
our common stock, less adjustments to reflect the fair value of the award as
dividends are not paid or accrued until vested, and is remeasured at each
reporting period date.

Note
12. Retirement Plans
 
Our defined benefit and defined contribution
plans cover substantially all of our employees. A significant number of our
U.S.-based employees participate in the Textron Master Retirement Plan (TMRP)
and the Bell Helicopter Textron Master Retirement Plan (BHTMRP), which are
subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA).
 
The TMRP is a defined benefit pension plan that
includes a new defined contribution component called the Retirement Account
Plan (RAP), which covers a portion of participants in the TMRP and BHTMRP,
and was created in 2007. Under the RAP, participants are eligible to receive 2%
of their annual compensation in contributions from Textron. Participants in the
RAP may not make contributions to the plan. Participants in the RAP may receive
pension benefits from the TMRP or the BHTMRP that are reduced by benefits
received under the RAP. We also have funded and unfunded defined benefit
pension plans that cover certain of our U.S. and foreign employees.
 
Several defined
contribution plans also are sponsored by our various businesses. The largest
such plan is the Textron Savings Plan (TSP), which is a qualified 401(k) plan
subject to ERISA in which a significant number of our U.S.-based employees
participate. Our defined contribution plans cost approximately $85 million in
2007, $50 million in 2006 and $45 million in 2005. The increase in cost in 2007
primarily relates to contributions of $24 million to the RAP and a higher
employee base, largely due to acquisitions.
 
We also provide postretirement benefits other
than pensions for certain retired employees in the U.S. and South Africa, which
include healthcare, dental care, Medicare Part B reimbursement and life
insurance benefits.

We estimate that the net loss and prior service

comprehensive income into net periodic benefit costs in 2008 will be $17
million and $18 million, respectively. The estimated net loss and prior service
credit for postretirement benefits other than pensions that will be amortized
from other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit costs in 2008 will be
$16 million and $(4) million, respectively.

In October 2006, we transferred $281
million of plan assets from the TMRP to a plan established by the purchaser of
our Fastening Systems business. This settled our obligation to the U.S.-based
employees of this business. Upon this transfer, we recognized a settlement loss
of $35 million, which is included in discontinued operations. Obligations
related to the Fastening Systems business foreign plans were assumed by the
purchaser.

level. We estimate an initial prescription drug rate of 12% in 2007, which we
assume will decrease by 5% by 2015 and then remain at that level.

Pension Assets
 
We invest our pension assets with the objective
of achieving a total rate of return, over the long term, sufficient to fund
future pension obligations and to minimize future pension contributions. We are
willing to tolerate a commensurate level of risk to achieve this objective
based on the funded status of the plans and the long-term nature of our pension
liability. Risk is controlled by maintaining a portfolio of assets that is
diversified across a variety of asset classes, investment styles and investment
managers. All of the assets are managed by external investment managers, and
the majority of the assets are actively managed. Where possible, investment
managers are prohibited from owning our stock in the portfolios that they
manage on our behalf.
 
64


 
For U.S. plan assets,
comprising the majority of plan assets, asset allocation target ranges were
established consistent with the investment objectives, and the assets are
rebalanced periodically. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
was determined based on a variety of considerations, including the established
asset allocation targets and expectations for those asset classes, historical
returns of the plans assets and other market considerations. At December 29,
2007, the target allocation range is 44% to 70% for equity securities, 13% to
33% for debt securities, and 7% to 13% for each of real estate and other
alternative assets. For foreign plan assets, allocations are based on expected
cash flow needs and assessments of the local practices and markets. The
percentages of the fair value of total U.S. pension plan assets by major
category are as follows:

Estimated
Future Cash Flow Impact
 
Defined benefits under
salaried plans are based on salary and years of service. Hourly plans generally
provide benefits based on stated amounts for each year of service. Our funding
policy is consistent with applicable laws and regulations. In 2008, we expect
to contribute in the range of $53 million to $57 million to fund our qualified
pension plans and foreign plans. We do not expect to contribute to our other
postretirement benefit plans. The benefit payments provided below reflect
expected future employee service, as appropriate, that are expected to be paid,
net of estimated participant contributions, but do not include the Medicare Part D
subsidy we expect to receive. The benefit payments are based on the same
assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of fiscal 2007.
While pension benefit payments primarily will be paid out of qualified pension
trusts, we will pay postretirement benefits other than pensions out of our
general corporate assets as follows:

13. Income Taxes
 
We conduct business
globally and, as a result, file numerous consolidated and separate income tax
returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. For all of our U.S. subsidiaries, we file a consolidated federal
income tax return. Income from continuing operations before income taxes is as

The amount of income
taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax
authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the
potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We assess
our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to
examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and
information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions for which
it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we record the
amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement
with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
Interest and penalties are accrued, where applicable. If we do not believe that
it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax
benefit is recognized.
 
However, our future
results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax
liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations, new regulatory or
judicial pronouncements, or other relevant events. As a result, our effective
tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.
 
We adopted the provisions of FASB
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), at the beginning of
fiscal 2007, which resulted in an increase of approximately $22 million to our December 31,
2006 retained earnings balance. FIN 48 provides a comprehensive model for the
financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.
Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions for which reserves have been
established. Unrecognized state tax benefits and interest related to
unrecognized tax benefits are reflected net of applicable tax benefits.

unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued interest, for 2007 is as follows:

At December 29,
2007, approximately $241 million of these unrecognized tax benefits, if
recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate in any future period.
The remaining $126 million in unrecognized tax benefits are related to
discontinued operations. We do not expect the amount of the unrecognized tax
benefits disclosed above to change significantly over the next 12 months.
 
In the normal course of business, we are subject
to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including major
jurisdictions such as Belgium, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the
United States. With few exceptions, we no longer are subject to U.S. federal,
state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 1997 in
these major jurisdictions.
 
During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized
approximately $28 million, $23 million and $14 million, respectively, in
interest. At the end of 2007 and 2006, we had $101 million and $77 million,
respectively, of accrued interest included in other liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Our income taxes
payable for federal and state purposes have been reduced by the tax benefits we
receive from employee stock options. The income tax benefits we receive for
certain stock options are calculated as the difference between the fair market
value of the stock issued at the time of exercise and the option price, tax
effected. These excess net tax benefits related to employee stock options are
presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as financing activities.
 
The undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries approximated $542 million at the end of
2007. We consider the undistributed earnings on which taxes have not previously
been provided to be indefinitely reinvested; therefore, tax is not provided on
these earnings. If the earnings on which tax has not been provided had been
distributed in 2007, our taxes, net of foreign tax credits, would have
increased by approximately $32 million.
 
Note
14. Special Charges
 
There were no special charges in 2007 or 2006.
In 2005, special charges totaled $118 million and included $112 million related
to the 2001 disposition of the Automotive Trim (Trim) business and $6 million
in restructuring expense in the Industrial segment.
 
In 2005, the $112
million in special charges that were incurred in connection with the
disposition of Trim included $91 million in impairment charges to write down
preferred stock acquired in the disposition and $21 million to cover exposures
related to certain guarantees for leases, environmental and workers
compensation matters.
 
Note
15. Commitments and Contingencies
 
We are subject to legal proceedings and other
claims arising out of the conduct of our business, including proceedings and
claims relating to private sector transactions; government contracts;
compliance with applicable laws and regulations; production partners; product
liability; employment; and environmental, safety and health matters. Some of
these legal proceedings and claims seek damages, fines or penalties in
substantial amounts or remediation of environmental contamination. As a
government contractor, we are subject to audits, reviews and investigations to
determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with
applicable regulatory requirements. Under federal government procurement
regulations, certain claims brought by the U.S. Government could result in our
being suspended or debarred from U.S. Government contracting for a period of
time. On the basis of information presently available, we do not believe that
existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.
 
68


 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has
challenged both the ability to accelerate the timing of tax deductions and the
amounts of those deductions related to certain leveraged lease transactions
within the Finance segment. These transactions, along with other transactions
with similar characteristics, have an initial investment of approximately $209
million. Resolution of these issues may result in an adjustment to the timing
of taxable income and deductions that reduce the effective yield of the leveraged
lease transactions. In addition, resolution of these issues could result in the
acceleration of cash payments to the IRS. At December 29, 2007, $180
million of deferred tax liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets related to these leases. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments
are inconsistent with the tax law in existence at the time the leases were
originated and intend to vigorously defend our position.
 
ARH Program  The Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH)
System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract is a cost plus incentive
fee contract under which our eligibility for fees is reduced as total contract
costs increase. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed certain phases of
the critical design review under the ARH SDD contract and determined the
initial production configuration of the aircraft, including aircraft
configuration changes required by the U.S. Government. Our cost estimates based
on this configuration, which included anticipated transition to production
costs, exceeded the fixed pricing contained in two options the U.S. Government
had under this program for the first two Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)
lots. The option for the first LRIP lot expired in 2006, while the option for
the second lot (for 18-36 aircraft) was set to expire in December 2007. At
that time, we were in discussions with the U.S. Government related to the
possible reinstatement of the first option, extension of the second option,
delivery schedule, number of units to be exercised under the options and
possible additional aircraft to be contracted, in addition to those under the
options, at revised pricing. At the end of 2006, due to the uncertainty of this
exposure and the ultimate outcome of our discussions with the U.S. Government,
we did not believe that a loss was probable under the guidelines established by
SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.
 
In March 2007, we received correspondence
from the U.S. Government that created uncertainty about whether it would proceed
into the production phase of the ARH program. Accordingly, we provided for
losses of $18 million in supplier obligations for long-lead component
production incurred at our own risk to support anticipated ARH LRIP contract
awards.
 
In the second quarter of 2007, the U.S. Army
agreed to re-plan the ARH program, and we reached a non-binding memorandum of
understanding (MOU) related to aircraft specifications, pricing methodology
and delivery schedules for initial LRIP aircraft. We also agreed to conduct additional
SDD activities on a funded basis. Based on the plan at that time and our
related estimates of aircraft production costs, including costs related to
risks associated with achieving learning curve and schedule assumptions, we
expected to lose approximately $73 million on the production of the proposed
initial LRIP aircraft. Accordingly, an additional charge of $55 million was
taken in the second quarter of 2007 for estimated LRIP contract losses.
 
In December 2007,
the U.S. Governments remaining option related to production of aircraft under
the original ARH program expired unexercised. We are continuing to restructure
the program through negotiations with the U.S. Government, including reducing
the number of units and modifying the pricing and delivery schedules previously
reached under the MOU. Based on the current status of these negotiations and
our contractual commitments with our vendors related to materials for the
anticipated production units we have procured at our risk, we have revised our
best estimate of the expected loss to $50 million, resulting in a $23 million
reduction of previously established reserves. We expect that the initial LRIP
contract awards will be finalized in mid-2008.
 
Environmental
Remediation
 
As with other industrial enterprises engaged in
similar businesses, we are involved in a number of remedial actions under
various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the environment that
impose liability on companies to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning
up, sites on which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed or released. Our
accrued environmental liabilities relate to disposal costs, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency oversight costs, legal fees, and operating and maintenance
costs for both currently and formerly owned or operated facilities.
Circumstances that can affect the reliability and precision of the accruals
include the identification of additional sites, environmental regulations,
level of cleanup required, technologies available, number and financial
condition of other contributors to remediation, and the time period over which
remediation may occur. We believe that any changes to the accruals that may
result from these factors and uncertainties will not have a material effect on
our financial position or results of operations.
 
69


 
Based upon information
currently available, we estimate that our potential environmental liabilities
are within the range of $42 million to $156 million. At the end of 2007,
environmental reserves of approximately $87 million, of which $10 million are
classified as current liabilities, have been established to address these
specific estimated potential liabilities. We estimate that we will likely pay
our accrued environmental remediation liabilities over the next five to 10
years. Expenditures to evaluate and remediate contaminated sites approximated
$7 million, $7 million and $6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
Leases
 
Rental expense approximated $107 million for
2007 and $89 million for each year in 2006 and 2005. Future minimum rental
commitments for noncancelable operating leases in effect at the end of 2007
approximated $66 million for 2008, $57 million for 2009, $47 million for 2010,
$36 million for 2011, $28 million for 2012 and a total of $173 million
thereafter.
 
Loan
Commitments
 
At December 29, 2007, our Finance group had
unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under $1.6 billion of
committed revolving lines of credit, compared with $1.3 billion at December 30,
2006. These loan commitments generally have an original duration of less than
three years and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since
many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire
unused. We are not exposed to interest rate changes on these commitments since
the interest rates are not set until the loans are funded.

Our customer-funded research and development
costs primarily are related to U.S. Government contracts, including the ARH,
V-22, VH-71 and H-1 development contracts.
 
As part of the
realignment of Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company LLC (BAAC) (see Note 18), Bell
Helicopter, Agusta S.p.A. and two of its affiliated companies (collectively, Agusta)
agreed to share certain Model BA609 development costs. On behalf of BAAC,
Agusta will incur development costs to enhance its investment in BAAC. Agusta
also may make cash contributions to reimburse portions of our development costs
incurred on behalf of BAAC. Based on development costs incurred, we received
$11 million, $19 million and $43 million in cash contributions from Agusta,
which were recorded in income in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
During 2005, Bell
Helicopter entered into four separate risk-sharing arrangements. Two of the
arrangements are with commercial participants in the development of the Bell
Model 429 aircraft. In 2007, one agreement was modified to reduce the amount of
cash and in-kind development efforts required from the participant, with
corresponding reductions in the entitlements the participant may obtain upon
future Model 429 production and sales. The arrangements require contributions
from the participants totaling $14 million, which are due once the development
effort reaches certain predetermined milestones, as well as in-kind development
contributions from one participant. The other two arrangements are with
Canadian governmental organizations. These arrangements, which currently
include the Model 429 aircraft and may potentially include certain future
aircraft, each require cash contributions of up to CAD 115 million from the
participants, based on a percentage of qualifying research and development
costs incurred.
 
Each of the participants under these
arrangements is entitled to payments from Bell Helicopter, with the commercial
participants also entitled to discounts, based on future sales of the Model 429
aircraft. In addition, there are certain requirements related to production of
future Model 429 aircraft in Canada. Based on the development activities
completed and costs incurred, we have recorded income of $22 million, $22
million and $35 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to these
arrangements.
 
In
2007, 2006 and 2005, we received, or were due to receive, $33 million, $41
million and $78 million, respectively, in cost reimbursements of company-funded
amounts from our risk-sharing partners. Based on these reimbursements, our net
company-funded costs totaled $332 million, $310 million and $248 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

* These
agreements include uncapped guarantees as described below.
 
Performance Guarantee
 
In 2004, through our
Bell Helicopter business, we formed AgustaWestlandBell LLC (AWB LLC) with
AgustaWestland North America Inc. (AWNA). This venture was created for the
joint design, development, manufacture, sale, customer training and product
support of the VH-71 helicopter, and certain variations and derivatives
thereof, to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the U.S.
Government. In March 2005, AWB LLC received a $1.2 billion cost
reimbursement-type subcontract from Lockheed Martin for the System Development
and Demonstration phase of the U.S. Marine Corps Helicopter Squadron Program.
We guaranteed to Lockheed Martin the due and prompt performance by AWB LLC of
all its obligations under this subcontract, provided that our liability under
the guaranty shall not exceed 49% of AWB LLCs aggregate liability to Lockheed
Martin under the subcontract. AgustaWestland N.V., AWNAs parent company, has
guaranteed the remaining 51% to Lockheed Martin. We have entered into
cross-indemnification agreements with AgustaWestland N.V. in which each party
indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements
that result from the indemnifying partys workshare under any subcontracts
received. AWB LLCs maximum obligation is 50% of the total contract value,
which equates to $613 million, for a maximum amount of our liability under the
guarantee of $300 million at December 29, 2007 through completion.
 
Guaranteed Minimum Resale
Contracts
 
We have a number of guaranteed minimum resale
value contracts associated with certain past aircraft sales. If the fair value
of an aircraft falls below a minimum guaranteed amount, we may be required to
make a future payment to the customer or provide a minimum trade-in value
toward a new aircraft. These agreements generally include operating
restrictions such as maximum usage over the contract period or minimum
maintenance requirements. We also have guaranteed the minimum resale value of
certain customer-owned aircraft anticipated to be traded in upon completion of
a model currently under development. These contracts expire as follows: $3
million in each year in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and $18 million in 2012.
 
Guarantees Related to
Dispositions
 
We indemnified the purchaser of
the Fastening Systems business for remediation costs related to pre-existing
environmental conditions to the extent they exist at the sold locations. We
have estimated the fair value of these indemnifications at approximately $28
million. Potential payments under these obligations are not capped and, as a
result, the maximum potential obligation cannot be determined. We also have
other obligations, some which are capped, arising from sales of certain other
businesses, including representations and warranties and related indemnities
for environmental, health and safety, and tax and employment matters. The
maximum potential payment related to other obligations that are capped is $17
million, while the maximum potential payment for the obligations that are not
capped cannot be determined. 
 
Loss-Sharing Agreements
 
In connection with the sale of
a note receivable in 2005, our Finance group has indemnified the purchaser
against potential losses in limited circumstances. The maximum potential
exposure of the indemnity is estimated to be $29 million, but, due to the
extremely low probability of occurrence and several other mitigating factors,
including a specific indemnification from the original note issuer, no
significant fair value has been attributed to the indemnity. 
 
71


 
Software Indemnifications
 
We enter into software license
agreements with customers through our Overwatch Systems business. These
software license agreements generally include certain provisions for
indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a
third partys intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any
material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any
liabilities related to such obligations. 
 
Forward Contract
 
We enter into a forward
contract in our common stock on an annual basis. The contract is intended to
hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stock-based incentive compensation
indexed to our stock. The forward contract requires annual cash settlement
between the counterparties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the
difference between the strike price and the prevailing common stock price. As
of December 29, 2007, the contract was for approximately 2.5 million
shares with a strike price of $47.28. The market price of the stock was $71.62
at December 29, 2007, resulting in a receivable of $62 million, compared
with a receivable of $24 million at December 30, 2006.
 
Warranty and
Product Maintenance Contracts
 
We provide limited warranty and product
maintenance programs, including parts and labor, for certain products for
periods ranging from one to five years. We estimate the costs that may be
incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such
costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect this
liability include the number of products sold, historical and anticipated rates
of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of our recorded
warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the
amounts as necessary.

and product maintenance liability are as follows:

Note 18.
Variable Interest Entities
 
In the normal course of
business, we have entered into various joint ventures or investments in other
entities that qualify as operating businesses. Generally, these ventures meet
the criteria for exclusion from the scope of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.
For those ventures or investments that are within the scope of this
Interpretation, we consolidate, as the primary beneficiary, the variable interest
entities in which we absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive
a majority of the entitys expected losses or both, as a result of contractual
or other financial interests in the entity.
 
BAAC is a joint venture established in 1998 between
our Bell Helicopter unit and a predecessor of Agusta S.p.A. to share certain
costs and profits for the joint design, development, manufacture, marketing,
sale, customer training and product support of the civil tiltrotor Model BA609
and, through December 2005, the commercial helicopter Model AB139. This
venture is a variable interest entity since it relies on its partners to fund
the development and to provide services for substantially all of the ventures
operations. We became the primary beneficiary of BAAC on December 20, 2005
when we obtained the controlling voting interest in the venture, along with the
right to absorb more than half of its expected losses and residual returns.
BAAC was consolidated prospectively in our financial statements as of December 20,
2005.
 
72




 
On December 20,
2005, we entered into an agreement with Agusta to realign BAAC. Under this
agreement, we sold our 25% profit interest in the Model AB139 medium twin
helicopter program to Agusta. Agusta assumed ownership of all aspects of the
Model AB139 program from BAAC, including all existing customer obligations. In
exchange for our interest, we received $10 million in cash, a $20 million note
and a note for contingent payments from Agusta based on future Model AB139
sales. We recognized a $30 million pre-tax gain upon the sale of our interest,
which is included in segment profit. The contingent receipts are expected to
begin with aircraft deliveries in 2008 and will be recorded into income
prospectively as the future sales occur. At the end of 2007 and 2006, Agustas
profit interest in the Model BA609 was approximately 32% and 30%, respectively.

     Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our control environment is
the foundation for our system of internal control and is embodied in our Business Code of Conduct,
which sets the tone of our company and includes our Core Values of Integrity, Teamwork, Performance
and Learning. Included in our system of internal control are written policies, an organizational
structure providing division of responsibilities, the selection and training of qualified personnel
and a program of financial and operations reviews by a professional staff of internal auditors.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.
     Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting. Our evaluation was based on the framework in
Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.
     Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework, our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. The conclusion of our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer is based on the recognition that there are
inherent limitations in all systems of internal control. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
     Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Baker Hughes Incorporated
Houston, Texas


     We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Baker Hughes Incorporated and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

     We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

     Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

     We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated
February 19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Companys adoption of new
accounting standards.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Baker Hughes Incorporated
Houston, Texas


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Baker Hughes Incorporated and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included financial statement schedule II,
valuation and qualifying accounts, listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Baker Hughes Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

     As described in Note 1 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements: effective as of
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position
(FSP) AUG AIR-1, which prohibits the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major
maintenance activities; effective as of January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation
48, which established new accounting and reporting standards for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in financial statements. Furthermore, as described in Note 4 and Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements: effective as of January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, which established new accounting and reporting
standards for stock-based compensation; effective as of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 158, which established new accounting and reporting standards for defined benefit pension
and other postretirement plans.

     We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

     Baker Hughes Incorporated (Baker Hughes) is engaged in the oilfield services industry.
Baker Hughes is a major supplier of products and technology services and systems to the worldwide
oil and natural gas industry and provides products and services for drilling, formation evaluation,
completion and production of oil and natural gas wells.

Basis of Presentation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Baker Hughes and all majority
owned subsidiaries (Company, we, our or us). Investments over which we have the ability to
exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not hold a controlling
interest, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, all dollar and share amounts in tabulations are in millions of dollars and
shares, respectively, unless otherwise indicated.

Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience
and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived
with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience
is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. While
we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used
for, but are not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts and
inventory valuation reserves, recoverability of long-lived assets, useful lives used in
depreciation and amortization, income taxes and related valuation allowances and insurance,
environmental, legal and pensions and postretirement benefit obligations.

Revenue Recognition

     Our products and services are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with the
customer that include fixed or determinable prices and that do not include right of return or other
similar provisions or other significant post-delivery obligations. Our products are produced in a
standard manufacturing operation, even if produced to our customers specifications, and are sold
in the ordinary course of business through our regular marketing channels. We recognize revenue
for these products upon delivery, when title passes, when collectibility is reasonably assured and
there are no further significant obligations for future performance. Provisions for estimated
warranty returns or similar types of items are made at the time the related revenue is recognized.
Revenue for services and rentals is recognized as the services are rendered and when collectibility
is reasonably assured. Rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per meter, per man
hour or similar basis.

Cash Equivalents

     We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Investments

     Prior to September 2007, we invested in auction rate securities, which are variable-rate debt
securities. While the underlying security has a long-term maturity, the interest rate is reset
through Dutch auctions that are typically held every 7, 28 or 35 days. The securities trade at par
and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer. Interest is paid
at the end of each auction period. We limited our investments in auction rate securities to non
mortgage-backed securities that carry a AAA (or equivalent) rating from a recognized rating agency.
The investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at cost, which we believe
approximates fair market value. At December 31, 2007, we held $35.6 million of auction rate
securities that were part of unsuccessful auctions. As a result of the unsuccessful auctions, the
interest rate now resets every 28 days at one month LIBOR plus 50 basis points and the liquidity of
these investments has been diminished. At December 31, 2007, based on our ability and intent

55

Table of Contents

Baker Hughes Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

to hold such investments, we have classified all investments in auction rate securities totaling
$35.6 million as noncurrent investments, which are included in other assets in our consolidated
balance sheet. At December 31, 2006, these investments were classified as short-term investments.

Inventories

     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method or the average cost method, which approximates FIFO, and includes the
cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation

     Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which
is generally provided by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
individual assets. Significant improvements and betterments are capitalized if they extend the
useful life of the asset. We manufacture a substantial portion of our rental tools and equipment
and the cost of these items, which includes direct and indirect manufacturing costs, are
capitalized and carried in inventory until the tool is completed. Once the tool has been
completed, the cost of the tool is reflected in capital expenditures and the tool is classified as
rental tools and equipment in PP&E. The capitalized costs of computer software developed or
purchased for internal use are classified in machinery and equipment in PP&E.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Amortization

     Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity method investments, and intangible assets
with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized
either on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life or on a basis that reflects
the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are realized.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

     We review property, intangible assets and certain other assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The
determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash
flows, excluding interest expense. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by
comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis, with the carrying value
of the related assets.

     We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill for each of our reporting units as of October
1, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. Our reporting units are
based on our organizational and reporting structure. Corporate and other assets and liabilities
are allocated to the reporting units to the extent that they relate to the operations of those
reporting units in determining their carrying amount. Investments in affiliates are also reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The
determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount with its fair value, which is
calculated using a combination of a market capitalization and discounted cash flow approach.

Income Taxes

     We use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred
tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this
method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined
using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax
benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.

     Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary
differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are
also provided for certain tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax
assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized.

     We intend to indefinitely reinvest certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in operations
outside the U.S., and accordingly, we have not provided for U.S. income taxes on such earnings. We
do provide for the U.S. and additional non-U.S. taxes on earnings anticipated to be repatriated
from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.

     We operate in more than 90 countries under many legal forms. As a result, we are subject to the
jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and
treaties among these governments. Our operations in these different

56

Table of Contents

Baker Hughes Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

jurisdictions are taxed on various bases: actual income before taxes, deemed profits (which are
generally determined using a percentage of revenues rather than profits) and withholding taxes
based on revenue. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation
of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding
significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible
revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax
credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange
restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each tax jurisdiction could have an
impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.

     Our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit by tax authorities in most
jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional
taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe that these
assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax
law. We have received tax assessments from various tax authorities and are currently at varying
stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters. We have provided for the amounts we
believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. We believe we have substantial defenses to
the questions being raised and will pursue all legal remedies should an unfavorable outcome result.
However, resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the
outcomes will be favorable. We provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to FIN 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

Product Warranties

     We sell certain products with a product warranty that provides that customers can return a
defective product during a specified warranty period following the purchase in exchange for a
replacement product, repair at no cost to the customer or the issuance of a credit to the customer.
We accrue amounts for estimated warranty claims based upon current and historical product sales
data, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to us.

Environmental Matters

     Estimated remediation costs are accrued using currently available facts, existing
environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we
are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal
evaluations and are not discounted. Such accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be
obligated to pay for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such
costs can be reasonably estimated. If the obligation can only be estimated within a range, we
accrue the minimum amount in the range. Such accruals are recorded even if significant
uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. As additional or more accurate
information becomes available, accruals are adjusted to reflect current cost estimates. Ongoing
environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation of pollution
control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred. Where we have been identified as a
potentially responsible party in a United States federal or state Superfund site, we accrue our
share of the estimated remediation costs of the site. This share is based on the ratio of the
estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the
site.

Foreign Currency

     A number of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their
functional currency and, as such, gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translation of
foreign operations are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss
within stockholders equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those
resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables in the non-functional currency, are
included in marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) expense in the consolidated statements
of operations as incurred. For those foreign subsidiaries that have designated the U.S. Dollar as
the functional currency, gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translation of foreign
operations are also included in MG&A expense in the consolidated statements of operations as
incurred. We recorded net foreign currency transaction and translation gains in MG&A in the
consolidated statement of operations of $10.7 million, $1.7 million and $6.8 million in 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

     We monitor our exposure to various business risks including commodity prices, foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates and occasionally use derivative financial instruments to manage
the impact of certain of these risks. Our policies do not permit the use of derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain
firm commitments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We have used and may use
interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk.

57

Table of Contents

Baker Hughes Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

     At the inception of any new derivative, we designate the derivative as a hedge as that term is
defined in SFAS 133 (as amended and interpreted) Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities or we determine the derivative to be undesignated as a hedging instrument as the facts
dictate. We document all relationships between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as
well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. We
assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item at both the inception of the hedge and on an
ongoing basis.

Reclassifications

     During the fourth quarter of 2007, we began classifying certain expenses as cost of sales and
cost of services and rentals that were previously classified as selling, general and administrative
expenses. The change was the result of an internal review to improve management reporting. The
reclassified expenses relate to selling and field service costs which are closely related to
operating activities. In addition, we have renamed selling, general and administrative expenses on
the statement of operations to marketing, general and administrative expenses to more accurately
describe the costs included therein. The impact of these reclassifications is to increase cost of
sales by $366.1 million, $318.6 million and $276.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively; increase cost of services and rentals by $123.9 million, $114.3
million and $104.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively; and
decrease marketing, general and administrative expense by $490.0 million, $432.9 million and $380.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These
reclassifications had no impact on total costs and expenses as these changes offset one another.
All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this new presentation.

New Accounting Standards

     In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and No. 140 (SFAS 155). SFAS 155 amends
SFAS 133, which required that a derivative embedded in a host contract that does not meet the
definition of a derivative be accounted for separately under certain conditions. SFAS 155 is
effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued (or subject to a remeasurement event)
following the start of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006. We
adopted SFAS 155 on January 1, 2007, and there was no impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

     In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes the minimum threshold a tax position is
required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides
guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 as required, and
recorded a reduction to beginning retained earnings of $64.2 million. See Note 6 for further
information.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. AUG AIR-1 (FSP AUG AIR-1), which
addresses the accounting for planned major maintenance activities. FSP AUG AIR-1 prohibits the use
of the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual
and interim financial reporting periods. We adopted FSP AUG AIR-1 on January 1, 2007 to change our
method of accounting for repairs and maintenance activities on certain rental tools from the
accrue-in-advance method to the direct expense method. The adoption resulted in the reversal of a
$34.2 million accrued liability for future repairs and maintenance (R&M) costs and the recording
of an income tax liability of $9.0 million. The net impact of $25.2 million has been recorded as
an increase to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. We did not restate any prior
periods as the impact was not material to our financial statements.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which
is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair
value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 was originally effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In November
2007, the FASB placed a one year deferral for the implementation of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial
assets and liabilities; however, SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that
are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements. We adopted SFAS 157 on
January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and
liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements, with no
impact on our consolidated financial statements. We will begin the new disclosure requirements in
the first quarter of 2008.

58

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)
(SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a
defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position
and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through
comprehensive income. Additionally, it requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan
as of the date of its year end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. SFAS 158
is effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006; however, the
requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal
year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2008. We adopted all requirements of SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, except for the funded status
measurement date requirement, which will be adopted on December 31, 2008, as allowed under SFAS
158. We currently do not expect there to be a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements as a result of the adoption of the funded status measurement date requirement.

     In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159
permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported
in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We adopted
SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008. We will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 159, and we
currently do not expect there to be a material, if any, impact on our consolidated financial
statements as a result of this adoption.

     In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting
standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary in an effort to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial
information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS 160 on January 1,
2009, and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.

     In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS
141R). SFAS 141R replaces FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. The statement retains
the purchase method of accounting used in business combinations but replaces SFAS 141 by
establishing principles and requirements for the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities
and goodwill, including the requirement that most transaction costs and restructuring costs be
expensed. In addition, the statement requires disclosures to enable users to evaluate the nature
and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141 is effective for business combinations
for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS 141R on January 1, 2009 for
acquisitions on or after this date.

NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     In the fourth quarter of 2005, our management initiated and our Board of Directors approved a
plan to sell the Baker Supply Products Division (Baker SPD), a product line group within the
Completion and Production segment, which distributes basic supplies, products and small tools to
the drilling industry. In March 2006, we completed the sale of Baker SPD and received cash
proceeds of $42.5 million. We recorded a gain on the sale of $19.2 million, net of tax of $11.0
million, which consisted of an after-tax gain on the disposal of $16.9 million and $2.3 million
related to the recognition of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments into
earnings.

     We have reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented to
reflect these operations as discontinued. Summarized financial information from discontinued
operations is as follows for the years ended December 31:

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS

     In January 2006, we acquired Nova Technology Corporation (Nova) for $55.4 million, net of
cash acquired of $3.0 million, plus assumed debt. Nova is a supplier of permanent monitoring,
chemical injection systems, and multi-line services for deepwater and subsea oil and gas well
applications. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $29.7 million of goodwill, $24.3 million
of intangible assets and assigned $2.6 million to in-process research and development. Under the
terms of the purchase agreement, the former owners of Nova are entitled to additional purchase
price consideration of up to $3.0 million based on certain post-closing events to the extent that
those events occur no later than January 31, 2016, of which $1.0 million was paid during 2007.

     In December 2005, we purchased Zeroth Technology Limited (Zertech), a developer of an
expandable metal sealing element, for $20.3 million in cash. As a result of the acquisition, we
recorded $9.4 million of goodwill and $10.3 million of intangible assets. Under the terms of the
purchase agreement, the former owners of Zertech are entitled to additional purchase price
consideration of up to approximately $14.0 million based on the performance of the business during
2006, 2007 and 2008.

     We owned a 50% interest in the QuantX Wellbore Instrumentation venture (QuantX) and in
October 2005, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in QuantX for $27.2 million. We recorded
$28.4 million of goodwill, $19.6 million of intangibles and assigned $5.1 million to in-process
research and development.

     All acquisitions above are included in the Completion and Production segment. For each of
these acquisitions, the purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed using a discounted cash flow approach. Amounts related to in-process
research and development were written off at the date of acquisition and are included in research
and engineering expenses. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented individually or
in the aggregate for these acquisitions because the effects of these acquisitions were not material
to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R), which establishes accounting for equity
instruments exchanged for employee services. SFAS 123(R) is a revision of SFAS 123 and supersedes
APB 25. Under the provisions of SFAS 123(R), stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date
of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the
employees service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant.

     Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based compensation to employees under the
intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25, as permitted under SFAS 123. Under this method,
compensation cost was recognized for the difference between the quoted market price of our common
stock on the date of grant and the amount, if any, the employee was required to pay for the common
stock (the exercise price). Accordingly, we did not recognize compensation cost for our stock
option awards or our employee stock purchase plan because we issue options at exercise prices equal
to the market value of our stock on the date of grant and because our employee stock purchase plan
was noncompensatory. We did record compensation cost for our restricted stock awards and
restricted stock units.

     We adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective application method and, accordingly, no
prior periods have been restated. Under this method, compensation cost recognized during the year
ended December 31, 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all stock-based awards granted prior
to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation cost for all stock-based
awards granted after January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance
with SFAS 123(R). Additionally, compensation cost is recognized based on awards ultimately
expected to vest, therefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical
forfeiture rates. SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and
revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures. As a result of the
adoption of SFAS 123(R), the balance in unearned compensation recorded in stockholders equity as
of January 1, 2006, of $12.4 million, net of tax, was reclassified to and reduced the balance of
capital in excess of par value.

     The FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123 (R)-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax
Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards (FSP 123(R)-3), provides an alternative method of
calculating excess tax benefits (the APIC pool) from the method defined in SFAS 123(R). A
one-time election to adopt the transition method in FSP 123(R)-3 is available to those entities
adopting SFAS 123(R). The Company has calculated the APIC pool using the alternative method
outlined in FSP 123(R)-3.

vesting of restricted stock awards and units; and issuances under the employee stock purchase plan.

     The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share for
the year ended December 31, 2005 if we had recognized compensation expense by applying the fair

Stock Options

     Our stock option plans provide for the issuance of incentive and non-qualified stock options
to directors, officers and other key employees at an exercise price equal to the fair market value
of the stock at the date of grant. Although subject to the terms of the stock option agreement,
substantially all of the stock options become exercisable in three equal annual installments,
beginning a year from the date of grant, and generally expire ten years from the date of grant.
The stock option plans provide for the acceleration of vesting upon the employees retirement;
therefore, the service period is reduced for employees that are or will become retirement eligible
during the vesting period and, accordingly, the recognition of compensation expense for these
employees is accelerated. Compensation cost related to stock options is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the vesting or service period and is net of forfeitures.

     The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table presents the weighted average assumptions
used in the option pricing model for options granted. The expected life of the options represents
the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding. For the year 2005, the expected
life was based on historical trends. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the expected
life is based on our historical exercise trends and post-vest termination data incorporated into a
forwardlooking stock price model. For the year 2005, our expected volatility is based on the
historical volatility of our stock for a period approximating the expected life. For the years
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, as allowed under the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff
Accounting Bulletin 107 (SAB 107), the expected volatility is based on our implied volatility,
which is the volatility forecast that is implied by the prices of our actively traded options to
purchase our stock observed in the market. The risk-free interest rate is based on the observed
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time the options were granted. The dividend yield is
based on our history of dividend payouts.

     The total intrinsic value of stock options (defined as the amount by which the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of exercise exceeds the exercise price of the option) exercised in
2007, 2006 and 2005 was $72.5 million, $73.6 million and $84.6 million, respectively. The income
tax benefit realized from stock options exercised was $18.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2007. The total fair value of options vested in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $19.6 million, $20.2
million and $20.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there was $10.4 million of total

     The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2007 was $86.7
million, of which $68.3 million relates to awards vested and exercisable and $18.4 million relates
to awards expected to vest. The intrinsic value for stock options outstanding is calculated as the
amount by which the quoted price of $82.60 of our common stock as of the end of 2007 exceeds the
exercise price of the options.

Restricted Stock Awards and Units

     In addition to stock options, officers, directors and key employees may be granted restricted stock
awards (RSA), which is an award of common stock with no exercise price, or restricted stock units
(RSU), where each unit represents the right to receive at the

end of a stipulated period one unrestricted share of stock with no exercise price. RSAs and RSUs
are subject to cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging over a three to five year period. We
determine the fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the market
price of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost for RSAs and RSUs is primarily
recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting or service period and is net of forfeitures.

     The weighted average grant date fair value per share for RSAs in 2006 and 2005 was $73.97 and
$44.28, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value per share for RSUs in 2006 and
2005 was $74.00 and $42.60, respectively.

     The total grant date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested in 2007 and 2006 was $16.3 million and
$10.6 million, respectively. There were no RSAs or RSUs that vested in 2005. As of December 31,
2007, there was $26.2 million and $6.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested RSAs and RSUs, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 1.8 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) allows eligible employees to elect to contribute on
an after-tax basis between 1% and 10% of their annual pay to purchase our common stock; provided,
however, an employee may not contribute more than $25,000 annually to the plan pursuant to Internal
Revenue Service restrictions. Shares are purchased at a 15% discount of the fair market value of
our common stock on January 1 or December 31, whichever is lower. We
currently have 14.5 million shares authorized for issuance under the ESPP, and at December 31,
2007, there were 2.9 million shares reserved for future issuance under the ESPP. Compensation
expense determined under SFAS 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2007 was calculated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

curve in effect at the time the ESPP shares were granted. The dividend yield is based on our
history of dividend payouts.

NOTE 5. SALE OF INTEREST AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

     We have investments in affiliates that are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. The most significant of these affiliates was our 30% interest in WesternGeco, a
seismic venture jointly owned with Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger). On April 28, 2006, we
sold our 30% interest in WesternGeco to Schlumberger for $2.4 billion in cash. We recorded a
pre-tax gain of $1,743.5 million ($1,035.2 million, after-tax). Prior to our sale, during 2006 and
2005, we received distributions of $59.6 million and $30.0 million, respectively, from WesternGeco,
which were recorded as reductions in the carrying value of our investment.

63

Table of Contents

Baker Hughes Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

     During 2005, we received $13.3 million from Schlumberger related to a true-up payment
associated with revenues earned by WesternGeco during the four year period ending November 2004
from each partys contributed multiclient seismic data libraries. We recorded $13.0 million as a
reduction in the carrying value of our investment in WesternGeco and $0.3 million as interest
income. The income tax effect of $3.3 million related to this payment is included in our provision
for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005.

     In November 2000, we entered into an agreement with WesternGeco, whereby WesternGeco subleases
a facility from us for a period of ten years at then current market rates. In 2006, we entered
into an extension of the sublease for five additional years with rent to be determined based on
market rates in 2010. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we received payments of $8.2 million, $5.6
million and $6.5 million, respectively, from WesternGeco related to this lease.

     The following table includes summarized unaudited combined financial information for the
affiliates in which we account for our interests using the equity method of accounting. Included
in the table for 2006 are the operating and financial position results for WesternGeco through
March 31, 2006, the most recent date for which information is available. All other information for
affiliates is as of December 31.

     During 2006, we provided $708.3 million for taxes related to the sale of our interest in
WesternGeco. Approximately $98.1 million of this tax provision is in excess of the U.S. statutory
income tax rate due to taxes provided on the expected repatriation of the non-U.S. proceeds
received in the transaction and a larger U.S. tax gain due to lower tax basis compared to book
basis.

     In 2005, we recognized a $10.6 million deferred tax asset attributable to the cumulative
temporary difference between the carrying values of our Supplemental Retirement Plan (SRP) for
financial reporting and income tax purposes, which had the effect of reducing tax expense.

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax effects
of our temporary differences and carryforwards are as follows at December 31:

     We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets
depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the
future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. We have provided a valuation allowance for
operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where our operations have decreased,
currently ceased or we have withdrawn entirely.

     We have provided for U.S. and additional foreign taxes for the anticipated repatriation of
certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We consider the undistributed earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries above the amount for which taxes have already been provided to be indefinitely
reinvested, as we have no intention to repatriate these earnings. As such, deferred income taxes
are not provided for temporary differences of approximately $1.6 billion, $0.8 billion and $0.4
billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries intended to be permanently reinvested. These additional foreign earnings could become
subject to additional tax if remitted, or deemed remitted, as a dividend. Computation of the
potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and other basis
difference is not practicable.

     At December 31, 2007, we had approximately $28.5 million of foreign tax credits which may be
carried forward indefinitely under applicable foreign law and $2.8 million of state tax credits
expiring in varying amounts between 2016 and 2021. The operating loss carryforwards without a
valuation allowance will expire in varying amounts over the next twenty years.

     In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 addresses the determination of whether tax
benefits (e.g. tax deductions or credits) claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should
be recorded in the financial statements as a reduction to income tax expense and related income tax
liabilities. Under FIN 48, the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is to be recognized as a
reduction to income tax expense when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of
the position, that the position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. Additionally, the amount of
the tax benefit to be recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than fifty
percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authorities. FIN 48
also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

     We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, pursuant to which we recognized a $78.5 million increase
in the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits which included $17.3 million of interest and
penalties. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized the following adjustments to
our accounts as of January 1, 2007.

     As of January 1, 2007, we had $422.8 million of tax liabilities for gross unrecognized tax
benefits, which includes liabilities for interest and penalties of $50.4 million and $18.1 million
respectively. If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a
benefit to our effective tax rate of approximately $339.2 million. The remaining approximately
$83.6 million, which is recorded as a deferred tax asset, represents tax benefits that would be
received in different taxing jurisdictions in the event that we did not prevail on all uncertain
tax positions.

     As of December 31, 2007, we had $456.9 million of tax liabilities for gross unrecognized tax
benefits, which includes liabilities for interest and penalties of $71.4 million and $22.1 million,
respectively. Our gross unrecognized tax benefits include $9.3 million of additional taxes and
related interest and penalties, recorded in 2007, that are associated with disallowed tax
deductions taken in previous years, arising from the resolution of investigations with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). If we were to
prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit to our effective tax rate
of approximately $373.3 million. The remaining approximately $83.6 million, which is recorded as a
deferred tax asset, represents tax benefits that would be received in different taxing
jurisdictions in the event that we did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.

     We have elected under FIN 48 to continue with our prior policy to classify interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income taxes in our financial statements. For
the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $25.0 million of interest and penalties expense
related to unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated statement of operations.

and penalties included in the balance sheet.

     It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve
months due to expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings
related to transfer pricing, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of litigation in
various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. At December 31, 2007, current taxes payable
included approximately $105.5 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which we expect to settle
within the next twelve months primarily as the result of audit settlements or statute expirations
in several taxing jurisdictions. The most significant uncertainties are due to possible transfer
pricing adjustments related to goods and services provided across borders in various countries.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

     At December 31, 2007, approximately $351.4 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits were
included in the non-current portion of our income tax liabilities, for which the settlement period
cannot be determined; however, it is not expected to be within the next twelve months.

     We operate in over 90 countries and are subject to income taxes in most taxing jurisdictions
in which we operate. The following table summarizes the earliest tax years that remain subject to
examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. These jurisdictions are those
we project to have the highest tax liability for 2007.

     Intangible assets are amortized either on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives
ranging from 1 to 20 years, or on a basis that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits
of the intangible assets are expected to be realized, which range from 15 to 30 years.

     Amortization expense included in net income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005 was $20.8 million, $20.0 million and $15.2 million, respectively. Estimated amortization
expense for each of the subsequent five fiscal years is expected to be as follows: 2008  $19.1
million; 2009  $18.3 million; 2010  $14.8 million; 2011  $13.8 million and 2012  $13.5 million.

     At December 31, 2007, we had $1,018.5 million of credit facilities with commercial banks, of
which $500.0 million is a committed revolving credit facility (the facility) that expires in July
2012. The facility provides for a one year extension, subject to the approval and acceptance by
the lenders, among other conditions. In addition, the facility contains a provision to allow for
an increase in the facility amount of an additional $500.0 million, subject to the approval and
acceptance by the lenders, among other conditions. The facility contains certain covenants which,
among other things, require the maintenance of a funded indebtedness to total capitalization ratio
(a defined formula per the facility) of less than or equal to 0.60, restrict certain merger
transactions or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or a significant
subsidiary and limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of certain events
of default, our obligations under the facility may be accelerated. Such events of default include
payment defaults to lenders under the facility, covenant defaults and other customary defaults. At
December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all of the facility covenants. There were no direct
borrowings under the facility during the year ended December 31, 2007; however, to the extent we
have outstanding commercial paper, our ability to borrow under the facility is reduced. At
December 31, 2007, we had no outstanding commercial paper.

     In prior years, we terminated various interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled
maturities resulting in net gains. The net gains were deferred and are being amortized as a net
reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt securities. The
unamortized net deferred gains of $5.3 million and $10.5 million are included in the 6.25% Notes
due January 2009 and reported in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively.

     Maturities of debt at December 31, 2007 are as follows: 2008  $15.4 million; 2009  $529.8
million; 2010  $0.0 million; 2011  $0.0 million, 2012  $0.0 million; and $539.6 million
thereafter.

NOTE 12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     Our financial instruments include cash and short-term investments, noncurrent investments in
auction rate securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, foreign currency forward
contracts and foreign currency option contracts. Except as described below, the estimated fair
value of such financial instruments at December 31, 2007 and 2006 approximates their carrying value
as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our debt and foreign currency
forward contracts has been estimated based on quoted year end market prices.

70

Table of Contents

Baker Hughes Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

     The estimated fair value of total debt at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $1,169.7 million and
$1,171.0 million, respectively, which differs from the carrying amounts of $1,084.8 million and
$1,075.1 million, respectively, included in our consolidated balance sheets.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

     At December 31, 2007, we had entered into several foreign currency forward contracts with
notional amounts aggregating $115.0 million to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various
foreign currency denominated accounts payable and accounts receivable, including the British Pound
Sterling, Norwegian Krone, Euro and the Brazilian Real. These contracts are designated and qualify
as fair value hedging instruments. Based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2007 for
contracts with similar terms and maturity dates, we recorded a gain of $1.1 million to adjust these
foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value. This gain offsets designated
foreign currency exchange losses resulting from the underlying exposures and is included in
marketing, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

     At December 31, 2007, we had entered into option contracts with notional amounts aggregating
$20.0 million as a hedge of fluctuations in the Russian Ruble exchange rate. The contracts were
not designated as hedging instruments. Based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2007 for
contracts with similar terms and maturity dates, we recorded a loss of $0.3 million to adjust the
carrying value of these contracts to their fair market value. This loss is included in marketing,
general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations.

     At December 31, 2006, we had entered into several foreign currency forward contracts with
notional amounts aggregating $105.0 million to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various
foreign currency payables and receivables, including British Pound Sterling, Norwegian Krone, Euro,
Indonesian Rupiah and Brazilian Real. These contracts were designated and qualified as fair value
hedging instruments. Based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2006 for contracts with
similar terms and maturity dates, we recorded a loss of $0.2 million to adjust these foreign
currency forward contracts to their fair market value. This loss offsets designated foreign
currency exchange gains resulting from the underlying exposures and is included in marketing,
general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

     The counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are major financial institutions.
The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a
continuing basis. In the unlikely event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a
foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency exchange rate
differential.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     We sell our products and services to numerous companies in the oil and natural gas industry.
Although this concentration could affect our overall exposure to credit risk, we believe that we
are exposed to minimal risk since the majority of our business is conducted with major companies
within the industry. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition
and generally do not require collateral for our accounts receivable. In some cases, we will
require payment in advance or security in the form of a letter of credit or bank guarantee.

     We maintain cash deposits with major banks that may exceed federally insured limits. We
periodically assess the financial condition of the institutions and believe that the risk of any
loss is minimal.

NOTE 13. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

     We are a provider of drilling, formation evaluation, completion and production products and
services to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry. We report results for our product-line
focused divisions under two segments: the Drilling and Evaluation segment and the Completion and
Production segment. We have aggregated the divisions within each segment because they have similar
economic characteristics and because the long-term financial performance of these divisions is
affected by similar economic conditions. They also operate in the same markets, which includes all
of the major oil and natural gas producing regions of the world. The results of each segment are
evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and
in assessing performance. The WesternGeco segment consisted of our 30% interest in WesternGeco,
which we sold in April 2006. The accounting policies of our segments are the same as those
described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.




 

 
The Drilling and Evaluation segment consists of the Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids
(drilling fluids), Hughes Christensen (oilfield drill bits), INTEQ (drilling,
measurement-while-drilling and logging-while-drilling) and Baker Atlas (wireline

formation evaluation and wireline completion services) divisions. The Drilling and
Evaluation segment provides products and services used to drill and evaluate oil and natural
gas wells.


 


 

 
The Completion and Production segment consists of the Baker Oil Tools (workover, fishing
and completion equipment), Baker Petrolite (oilfield specialty chemicals) and Centrilift
(electrical submersible pumps and progressing cavity pumps) divisions and the
ProductionQuest (production optimization and permanent monitoring) business unit. The
Completion and Production segment provides equipment and services used from the completion
phase through the productive life of oil and natural gas wells.



     The performance of our segments is evaluated based on segment profit (loss), which is defined
as income from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, interest and dividend
income and accounting changes. The Corporate and Other column includes corporate-related items,
the pre-tax gain on the sale of our interest in WesternGeco of $1,743.5 million, the financial
charge of $46.1 million recorded in connection with the settlement negotiations with the SEC and
DOJ, results of insignificant operations and, as it relates to segment profit (loss), income and
expense not allocated to the segments. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we started allocating
certain expenses previously reported in Corporate and Other, to the Drilling and Evaluation and
Completion and Production segments. These expenses consist of administrative operations support
costs that are more closely related to operating activities. The impact of this allocation was a
reduction to Corporate and Other of $15.4 million, $12.2 million and $33.1 million for the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. All prior periods have been reclassified to
conform to this new presentation.

     The Corporate and Other column also includes assets of discontinued operations as of
December 31, 2005. Summarized financial information is shown in the following table.

NOTE 14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

     We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (Pension Benefits) covering employees
primarily in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany. In the U.S., we merged two pension plans effective
January 1, 2007, resulting in one tax-qualified U.S. pension plan, the Baker Hughes Incorporated
Pension Plan (BHIPP). Under the provisions of BHIPP, a hypothetical cash balance account is
established for each participant. Such accounts receive pay credits on a quarterly basis. The
quarterly pay credit is based on a

73

Table of Contents

Baker Hughes Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

percentage according to the employees age on the last day of the quarter applied to quarterly
eligible compensation. In addition to quarterly pay credits, a cash balance account receives
interest credits based on the balance in the account on the last day of the quarter. The BHIPP
also includes frozen accrued benefits for participants in legacy defined benefit plans. For the
majority of the participants in the U.K. pension plans, we do not accrue benefits as the plans are
frozen; however, there are a limited number of members who still accrue future benefits on a
defined benefit basis. The Germany pension plan is an unfunded plan where benefits are based on
creditable years of service, creditable pay and accrual rates. We also provide certain
postretirement health care benefits (other postretirement benefits), through an unfunded plan, to
substantially all U.S. employees who retire and have met certain age and service requirements.

     We adopted SFAS 158 effective December 31, 2006. SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize
the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined pension and postretirement benefit plans as a
net asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that
funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. Additionally,
SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of
its year end statement of financial position. We will adopt this provision on December 31, 2008,
as allowed under SFAS 158, using the Alternative Method to transition to a fiscal year-end
measurement date. The funded status of all our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are
currently measured as of October 1 of each year presented.

Funded Status

     Below is the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of benefit obligations, fair
value of plan assets and the funded status of our plans. For our pension plans, the benefit
obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and for our other post-retirement benefit
plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO).

     We have investment committees that meet at least quarterly to review the portfolio returns and
periodically to determine asset-mix targets based on asset/liability studies. Third-party
investment consultants assisted us in developing asset allocation strategies to determine our
expected rates of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. The investment
committees considered these studies in the formal establishment of the current asset-mix targets
based on the projected risk and return levels for all major asset classes.

     The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the actuarial present value of pension benefits
attributed to employee service to date and present compensation levels. The ABO differs from the
PBO in that the ABO does not include any assumptions about future compensation levels. The ABO for
all U.S. plans was $275.2 million and $260.9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The ABO for all non-U.S. plans was $309.0 million and $353.3 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

     Information for the plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets is as follows at December 31:

     The development of the discount rate for our U.S. plans was based on a bond matching model
whereby a hypothetical bond portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income securities is selected that
will match the cash flows underlying the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate
assumption for our non-U.S. plans reflects the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income
securities.

     The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will
be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next
fiscal year are $1.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The estimated prior service cost for
the other postretirement benefits that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss
into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $1.1 million.

     In selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, we consider the average rate of
earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits of these
plans. This includes considering the trusts asset allocation and the expected returns likely to
be earned over the life of the plans.

Expected Cash Flows

     For all pension plans, we make annual contributions to the plans in amounts equal to or
greater than amounts necessary to meet minimum governmental funding requirements. As a result of
the merger of our U.S. plans effective January 1, 2007, BHIPP is overfunded; therefore, we are not
required nor do we intend to make pension contributions to BHIPP in 2008, and we currently estimate
that we will not be required to make contributions to BHIPP for four to seven years thereafter. In
2008, we expect to contribute between $2.0 million and $3.0 million to our nonqualified U.S.
pension plans and between $13.0 million and $15.0 million to the non-U.S. pension plans.

     The following table presents the expected benefit payments over the next ten years. The U.S.
and non-U.S. pension benefit payments are made by the respective pension trust funds. The other
postretirement benefits are net of expected Medicare subsidies of approximately $2.2 million per
year and are payments that are expected to be made by us.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

     Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
other postretirement benefits. As of December 31, 2007, the health care cost trend rate was 8.5%
for employees under age 65 and 6.5% for participants over age 65, with each declining gradually
each successive year until it reaches 5.0% for both employees under age 65 and over age 65 in 2012.
A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

     During the periods reported, generally all of our U.S. employees were eligible to participate
in our sponsored Thrift Plan, which is a 401(k) plan under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code). The Thrift Plan allows eligible employees to elect to contribute from 1% to
50% of their salaries to an investment trust. Beginning January 1, 2007, employee contributions
are matched by the Company in cash at the rate of $1.00 per $1.00 employee contribution for the
first 5% of the employees salary. In prior years, employee contributions were matched in cash by
us at the rate of $1.00 per $1.00 employee contribution for the first 3% and $0.50 per $1.00
employee contribution for the next 2% of the employees salary.
In all years, such contributions
vest immediately. In addition, we make cash contributions for all eligible employees between 2%
and 5% of their salary depending on the employees age. Such contributions are fully vested to the
employee after three years of employment. The Thrift Plan provides for ten different investment
options, for which the employee has sole discretion in determining how both the employer and
employee contributions are invested. Our contributions to the Thrift Plan and several other
non-U.S. defined contribution plans amounted to $130.7 million, $102.2 million and $86.5 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

     For certain non-U.S. employees who are not eligible to participate in the Thrift Plan, we
provide a non-qualified defined contribution plan that provides basically the same benefits as the
Thrift Plan. In addition, we provide a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan (SRP) for
certain officers and employees whose benefits under the Thrift Plan and/or the U.S. defined benefit
pension plan are limited by federal tax law. The SRP also allows the eligible employees to defer a
portion of their eligible compensation and provides for employer matching and base contributions
pursuant to limitations. Both non-qualified plans are invested through trusts, and the assets and
corresponding liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheet. Our contributions to
these non-qualified plans were $11.0 million, $8.3 million and $7.2 million for 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

     In 2008, we expect to contribute between $142.0 million and $153.0 million to our defined
contribution plans.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

     We provide certain postemployment disability income, medical and other benefits to
substantially all qualifying former or inactive U.S. employees. Income benefits for long-term
disability are provided through a fully-insured plan. The continuation of medical and other
benefits while on disability (Continuation Benefits) are provided through a qualified
self-insured plan. The accrued postemployment liability for Continuation Benefits at December 31,
2007 and 2006 was $14.4 million and $17.6 million, respectively, and is included in other
liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

     At December 31, 2007, we had long-term non-cancelable operating leases covering certain
facilities and equipment. The minimum annual rental commitments, net of amounts due under
subleases, for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2012 are $95.0 million,
$64.9 million, $43.2 million, $29.5 million and $21.7 million, respectively, and $123.0 million in
the aggregate thereafter. We have not entered into any significant capital leases during the three
years ended December 31, 2007.

Litigation

     We are involved in litigation or proceedings that have arisen in our ordinary business
activities. We insure against these risks to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to
the extent insurance is available, but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that
insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and
future legal proceedings. Many of these insurance policies contain deductibles or self-insured
retentions in amounts we deem prudent and for which we are responsible for payment. In determining
the amount of self-insurance, it is our policy to self-insure those losses that are predictable,
measurable and recurring in nature, such as claims for automobile liability, general liability and
workers compensation. We record accruals for the uninsured portion of losses related to these
types of claims. The accruals for losses are calculated by estimating losses for claims using
historical claim data, specific loss development factors and other information as necessary.

     On March 29, 2002, we announced that we had been advised that the SEC and the DOJ were
conducting investigations into allegations of violations of law relating to Nigeria and other
related matters. The SEC issued a formal order of investigation into possible violations of
provisions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) regarding antibribery, books and
records and internal controls. In connection with the investigations, the SEC issued subpoenas
seeking information about our operations in Angola (subpoena dated August 6, 2003) and Kazakhstan
(subpoenas dated August 6, 2003 and April 22, 2005) as part of its ongoing investigation. We
provided documents to and cooperated fully with the SEC and DOJ. In addition, we conducted
internal investigations into these matters. Our internal investigations identified issues
regarding the propriety of certain payments and apparent deficiencies in our books and records and
internal controls with respect to certain operations in Angola, Kazakhstan and Nigeria, as well as
potential liabilities to government authorities in Nigeria. Evidence obtained during the course of
the investigations was provided to the SEC and DOJ.

     On April 26, 2007, the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division (the Court) unsealed a three-count criminal information that had been filed against us
as part of the execution of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the DPA) between us and the DOJ.
The three counts arise out of payments made to an agent in connection with a project in Kazakhstan
and include conspiracy to violate the FCPA, a substantive violation of the antibribery provisions
of the FCPA, and a violation of the FCPAs books-and-records provisions. All three counts relate
to our operations in Kazakhstan during the period from 2000 to 2003. Although we did not plead
guilty to that information, we face prosecution under that information, and possibly under other
charges as well, if we fail to comply with the terms of the DPA. Those terms include, for the
two-year term of the DPA, full cooperation with the government; compliance with all federal
criminal law, including but not limited to the FCPA; and adoption of a Compliance Code containing
specific provisions intended to prevent violations of the FCPA. The DPA also requires us to retain
an independent monitor for a term of three years to assess and make recommendations about our
compliance policies and procedures and our implementation of those procedures. Provided that we
comply with the DPA, the DOJ has agreed not to prosecute us for violations of the FCPA based on
information that we have disclosed to the DOJ regarding our operations in Nigeria, Angola,
Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan, among other countries.

     On the same date, the Court also accepted a plea of guilty by our subsidiary Baker Hughes
Services International, Inc. (BHSII) pursuant to a plea agreement between BHSII and the DOJ (the
Plea Agreement) based on similar charges relating to the same conduct. Pursuant to the Plea
Agreement, BHSII agreed to a three-year term of organizational probation. The Plea Agreement
contains provisions requiring BHSII to cooperate with the government, to comply with all federal
criminal law, and to adopt a Compliance Code similar to the one that the DPA requires of the
Company.

     Also on April 26, 2007, the SEC filed a Complaint (the SEC Complaint) and a proposed order (the
SEC Order) against us in the Court. The SEC Complaint and the SEC Order were filed as part of a
settled civil enforcement action by the SEC, to resolve the civil portion of the governments
investigation of us. As part of our agreement with the SEC, we consented to the filing of the SEC
Complaint without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, and also consented to the
entry of the SEC Order. The SEC Complaint alleges civil violations of the FCPAs antibribery
provisions related to our operations in Kazakhstan, the FCPAs books-

and-records and internal-controls provisions related to our operations in Nigeria, Angola,
Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Russia, and Uzbekistan, and the SECs cease and desist order of September
12, 2001. The SEC Order became effective on May 1, 2007, which is the date it was confirmed by the
Court. The SEC order enjoins us from violating the FCPAs antibribery, books-and-records, and
internal-controls provisions. As in the DPA, it requires that we retain the independent monitor to
assess our FCPA compliance policies and procedures for the three-year period.

     Under the terms of the settlements with the DOJ and the SEC, the Company and BHSII paid in the
second quarter of 2007, $44.1 million ($11 million in criminal penalties, $10 million in civil
penalties, $19.9 million in disgorgement of profits and $3.2 million in pre-judgment interest) to
settle these investigations. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded a financial charge for the
potential settlement.

     We have retained, and the SEC and DOJ have approved, an independent monitor to assess our FCPA
compliance policies and procedures for the specified three-year period.

     On May 4, 2007 and May 15, 2007, The Sheetmetal Workers National Pension Fund and Chris
Larson, respectively, instituted shareholder derivative lawsuits for and on the Companys behalf
against certain current and former members of the Board of Directors and certain officers, and the
Company as a nominal defendant, following the Companys settlement with the DOJ and SEC in April
2007. On August 17, 2007, The Alaska Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry Pension Trust also
instituted a shareholder derivative lawsuit for and on the Companys behalf against certain current
and former members of the Board of Directors and certain officers, and the Company as a nominal
defendant. The complaints in all three lawsuits allege, among other things, that the individual
defendants failed to implement adequate controls and compliance procedures to prevent the events
addressed by the settlement with the DOJ and SEC. The relief sought in the lawsuits includes a
declaration that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, an award of damages sustained by
the Company as a result of the alleged breach and monetary and injunctive relief, as well as
attorneys and experts fees. The lawsuits brought by the Sheetmetal Workers National Pension
Fund and The Alaska Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry Pension Trust are pending in the Houston
Division of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. These lawsuits
have been consolidated and an amended complaint in the consolidated action was filed on October 15,
2007. The lawsuit brought by Chris Larson is pending in the 215th District Court of Harris County,
Texas. We do not expect these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial statements.

     On May 12, 2006, Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc. (BHOO), a subsidiary of the Company,
was named as a defendant in a lawsuit in the United States District Court, Eastern District of
Texas brought by Reed Hycalog against BHOO and other third parties arising out of alleged patent
infringement relating to the sale of certain diamond drill bits utilizing certain types of
polycrystalline diamond cutters sold by our Hughes Christensen division. Reed Hycalog seeks
compensatory damages and injunctive relief against the defendants, as well as attorneys fees and
other costs. On September 11, 2007, the court issued a ruling regarding the scope of Reed
Hycalogs patent infringement claims. On January 18, 2008, Reed Hycalog filed with the court a
report claiming an amount of compensatory damages due from Baker Hughes ranging from approximately
$51 million to approximately $226 million. Reed Hycalog has also claimed they are entitled to
enhanced damages and attorney fees. The Company and BHOO believe they have reasonable defenses to
these claims and have asserted counter-claims for infringement by Reed Hycalog of certain of our
drill bit patents in the lawsuit. We are not able to predict the outcome of this litigation or its
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

     Further
information is contained in the Environmental Matters
section of Item 1. Business and Item 3. Legal Proceedings both
contained herein.

Environmental Matters

     Our past and present operations include activities which are subject to extensive domestic
(including U.S. federal, state and local) and international environmental regulations with regard
to air, land and water quality and other environmental matters. Our environmental procedures,
policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to
minimize the possibility of significant environmental damage.

     We are involved in voluntary remediation projects at some of our present and former
manufacturing locations or other facilities, the majority of which relate to properties obtained in
acquisitions or to sites no longer actively used in operations. On rare occasions, remediation
activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order.
Remediation costs are accrued based on estimates of probable exposure using currently available
facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations.
Remediation cost estimates include direct costs related to the environmental investigation,
external consulting activities, governmental oversight fees, treatment equipment and costs
associated with long-term operation, maintenance and monitoring of a remediation project.

79

Table of Contents

Baker Hughes Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

     We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in remedial activities
related to various Superfund sites. We participate in the process set out in the Joint
Participation and Defense Agreement to negotiate with government agencies, identify other PRPs,
determine each PRPs allocation and estimate remediation costs. We have accrued what we believe to
be our pro-rata share of the total estimated cost of remediation and associated management of these
Superfund sites. This share is based upon the ratio that the estimated volume of waste we
contributed to the site bears to the total estimated volume of waste disposed at the site.
Applicable United States federal law imposes joint and several liability on each PRP for the
cleanup of these sites leaving us with the uncertainty that we may be responsible for the
remediation cost attributable to other PRPs who are unable to pay their share. No accrual has been
made under the joint and several liability concept for those Superfund sites where our
participation is de minimis since we believe that the probability that we will have to pay material
costs above our volumetric share is remote. We believe there are other PRPs who have greater
involvement on a volumetric calculation basis, who have substantial assets and who may be
reasonably expected to pay their share of the cost of remediation. For those Superfund sites where
we are a significant PRP, remediation costs are estimated to include recalcitrant parties. In some
cases, we have insurance coverage or contractual indemnities from third parties to cover a portion
of or the ultimate liability.

     Our total accrual for environmental remediation is $16.9 million and $17.3 million, which
includes accruals of $5.3 million and $5.9 million for the various Superfund sites, at December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. The determination of the required accruals for remediation costs is
subject to uncertainty, including the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the
difficulty in estimating the extent and type of remediation activity that will be utilized. We
believe that the likelihood of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued is remote.

Other

     In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into
off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which
totaled approximately $466.8 million at December 31, 2007. We also had commitments outstanding for
purchase obligations related to capital expenditures and inventory under purchase orders and
contracts of approximately $293.1 million at December 31, 2007. It is not practicable to estimate
the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either
has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Asset Retirement Obligations

     On December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations (FIN 47). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation
as used in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation
to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The
obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists
about the timing and/or method of settlement. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation.
The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in a charge of $0.9 million, net of tax of $0.5 million, recorded
as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations. In
conjunction with the adoption, we recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of $1.6 million
as the fair value of the costs associated with the special handling of asbestos related materials
in certain facilities.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

     We have certain facilities that contain asbestos related materials for which a liability has
not been recognized because we are unable to determine the time frame over which these obligations
may be settled. Our normal practice is to conduct asbestos abatement procedures when required by
contractual requirements related to asset disposals or when a facility with asbestos is subject to
significant renovation or is demolished. We have no plans or expectations to sell, abandon or
demolish these other facilities nor do we anticipate the need for major renovations to them
resulting from technological or operations changes or other factors. We expect these other
facilities to be operational in their current state for the foreseeable future and, therefore, the
time frame over which these obligations will be settled cannot be determined. As a result,
sufficient information does not exist to enable us to reasonably estimate the fair value of the
asset retirement obligation.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
    



To the Stockholders and Board
    of Directors of Zimmer Holdings, Inc.:
    


 

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Zimmer
    Holdings, Inc, and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is
    responsible for these financial statements and financial
    statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
    over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Managements Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express opinions on these financial statements, on the
    financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

 

    As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain tax positions in 2007. As discussed in
    Notes 3 and 10, respectively, to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation in 2006 and defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement plans effective December 31, 2006.

 

    A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    companys assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

 

    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BUSINESS



 

    We design, develop, manufacture and market reconstructive
    orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal
    implants, trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical
    products. We also provide other healthcare related services.
    Joint reconstructive implants restore function lost due to
    disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and
    elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore function and
    aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or
    disease. Spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons
    and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases,
    deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma
    products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize
    damaged bone and tissue to support the bodys natural
    healing process. Our related orthopaedic surgical products
    include surgical supplies and instruments designed to aid in
    orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation
    rehabilitation. We have operations in more than 25 countries and
    market our products in more than 100 countries. We operate in a
    single industry but have three reportable geographic segments,
    the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.

 

    The words we, us, our and
    similar words refer to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES



 

Basis of Presentation  The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Zimmer Holdings and
    its subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling equity
    position. Investments in companies in which we exercise
    significant influence over the operating and financial affairs,
    but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method.
    Under the equity method, we record the investment at cost and
    adjust the carrying amount of the investment by our
    proportionate share of the investees net earnings or
    losses. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
    are eliminated. Certain amounts in the 2006 consolidated
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
    2007 presentation.

 

Use of Estimates  The consolidated financial
    statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that
    are based on managements best estimates and judgments.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Foreign Currency Translation  The financial
    statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into
    U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and
    liabilities and average exchange rates for operating results.
    Unrealized translation gains and losses are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders
    equity. When a transaction is denominated in a currency other
    than the subsidiarys functional currency, we recognize a
    transaction gain or loss when the transaction is settled.
    Foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in net
    earnings for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were not significant.

 

Revenue Recognition  We sell product through
    three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare
    institutions, referred to as direct channel accounts,
    2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and
    3) directly to dental practices and dental laboratories.
    The direct channel accounts represent approximately
    80 percent of our net sales. Through this channel,
    inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers so
    that products are available when needed for surgical procedures.
    No revenue is recognized upon the placement of inventory into
    consignment as we retain title and maintain the inventory on our
    balance sheet. Upon implantation, we issue an invoice and
    revenue is recognized. Pricing for products is generally
    predetermined by contracts with customers, agents acting on
    behalf of customer groups or by government regulatory bodies,
    depending on the market. Price discounts under group purchasing
    contracts are generally linked to volume of implant purchases by
    customer healthcare institutions within a specified group. At
    negotiated thresholds within a contract buying period, price
    discounts may increase. Revenue is recognized on sales to
    stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices and
    dental laboratories, which account for approximately
    20 percent of our net sales, when title to product passes
    to them, generally upon shipment. Product is generally sold to
    distributors at fixed prices for specified periods. A
    distributor may return product in the event that we terminate
    the relationship. Under those circumstances, we record an
    estimated sales return in the period in which constructive
    notice of termination is given to a distributor. Product returns
    were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005.

 

    The reserves for doubtful accounts were $21.7 million and
    $20.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

 

Shipping and Handling  Amounts billed to
    customers for shipping and handling of products are reflected in
    net sales, and are not significant. Expenses incurred related to
    shipping and handling of products are reflected in selling,
    general and administrative and were $104.1 million,
    $95.5 million and $91.6 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

 

Acquisition, Integration and Other  We
    recognize incremental expenses resulting directly from our
    business combinations and significant nonrecurring items as
    Acquisition, integration and other expenses.
    Acquisition, integration and other expenses for the years ended

    In-process research and development charges for 2007 are related
    to the acquisitions of Endius and ORTHOsoft. Included in the
    gain/loss on disposition or impairment of acquired assets and
    obligations for 2006 is the sale of the former Centerpulse
    Austin land and facilities for a gain of $5.1 million and
    the favorable settlement of two pre-acquisition contingent
    liabilities. These gains were offset by a $13.4 million
    impairment charge for certain Centerpulse tradename and
    trademark intangibles based principally in our Europe operating
    segment.

 

Cash and Equivalents  We consider all highly
    liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
    less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in
    the balance sheet for cash and equivalents are valued at cost,
    which approximates their fair value. Restricted cash is
    primarily composed of cash held in escrow related to certain
    insurance coverage.

 

Inventories  Inventories, net of allowances
    for obsolete and slow-moving goods, are stated at the lower of
    cost or market, with cost determined on a
    first-in
    first-out basis.

 

Property, Plant and Equipment  Property, plant
    and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
    estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and
    improvements, three to eight years for machinery and equipment
    and generally five years for instruments. Maintenance and
    repairs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets, we review property, plant and equipment
    for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
    recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
    estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset
    are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset
    exceeds its fair value.

 

Software Costs  We capitalize certain computer
    software and software development costs incurred in connection
    with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use
    when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is
    probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized
    software costs generally include external direct costs of
    materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining
    computer software and compensation and related benefits for
    employees who are directly associated with the software project.
    Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and
    equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line
    basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives
    of the software, which approximate three to seven years.

 

Instruments  Instruments are hand held devices
    used by orthopaedic surgeons during total joint replacement and
    other surgical procedures. Instruments are recognized as
    long-lived assets and are included in property, plant and
    equipment. Undeployed instruments are carried at cost, net of
    allowances for excess and obsolete instruments. Instruments in
    the field are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
    average estimated useful lives, determined principally in
    reference to associated product life cycles, primarily five
    years. We review instruments for impairment in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144. Depreciation of instruments is
    recognized as selling, general and administrative expense.

 

Goodwill  We account for goodwill in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill has been assigned
    to reporting units, which are consistent with our operating
    segments. We perform annual impairment tests by comparing each
    reporting units fair value to its carrying amount to
    determine if there is potential impairment. We perform this test
    in the fourth quarter of the year. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of
    the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value of
    the reporting unit goodwill. The fair value of the reporting
    unit and the implied fair value of goodwill are determined based
    upon market multiples.

 

Intangible Assets  We account for intangible
    assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Intangible
    assets are initially measured at their fair value. We have
    determined the fair value of our intangible assets either by the
    fair value of the consideration exchanged for the intangible
    asset, or the estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected
    to be generated from the intangible asset. Intangible assets
    with an indefinite life, including certain trademarks and trade
    names, are not amortized. The useful lives of indefinite life
    intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether
    events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life.
    Intangible assets with a finite life, including core and
    developed technology, certain trademarks and trade names,

    Financial Statements
    (Continued)


 

    customer related intangibles and patents and licenses are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
    life, ranging from three to forty years. Intangible assets with
    an indefinite life are tested for impairment annually, or
    whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized
    if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the
    asset. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be
    determined based upon the excess of the assets carrying
    value over its fair value. Intangible assets with a finite life
    are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

 

    The useful lives of intangible assets range from 3 to
    40 years. In determining the useful lives of intangible
    assets, we consider the expected use of the assets and the
    effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, anticipated
    technological advances, changes in surgical techniques, market
    influences and other economic factors. For technology based
    intangible assets, we consider the expected life cycles of
    products, absent unforeseen technological advances, which
    incorporate the corresponding technology. Trademarks and trade
    names that do not have a wasting characteristic (i.e., there are
    no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or
    other factors which limit the useful life) are assigned an
    indefinite life. Trademarks and trade names that are related to
    products expected to be phased out are assigned lives consistent
    with the period in which the products bearing each brand are
    expected to be sold. For customer relationship intangible
    assets, we assign useful lives based upon historical levels of
    customer attrition.

 

Research and Development  We expense all
    research and development costs as incurred. Research and
    development costs include salaries, prototypes, depreciation of
    equipment used in research and development, consultant fees and
    amounts paid to collaborative partners.

 

Income Taxes  We account for income taxes in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
    Income Taxes and related interperations, including
    FIN 48. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
    based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases
    of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
    rates in effect for the years in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. Federal income taxes are provided on the
    portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected
    to be remitted to the U.S.

 

Derivative Financial Instruments  We account
    for all derivative financial instruments in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by
    SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
    Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 133) and SFAS No. 149,
    Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 requires that
    all derivative instruments be reported as assets or liabilities
    on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. We maintain
    written policies and procedures that permit, under appropriate
    circumstances and subject to proper authorization, the use of
    derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes.
    The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes is prohibited by our policy. We are exposed
    to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. As a
    result, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to offset
    the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated foreign
    currency transactions, generally intercompany sales and
    purchases expected to occur within the next twelve to thirty
    months. Derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges
    are designated as such from inception. We maintain formal
    documentation regarding our objectives, the nature of the risk
    being hedged, identification of the instrument, the hedged
    transaction, the hedging relationship and how effectiveness of
    the hedging instrument will be assessed. Our policy requires
    that critical terms of a hedging instrument are effectively the
    same as a hedged forecasted transaction. On this basis, with
    respect to a cash flow hedge, changes in cash flows attributable
    to the hedged transaction are generally expected to be
    completely offset by the cash flows attributable to hedge
    instruments. We, therefore, perform quarterly assessments of
    hedge effectiveness by verifying and documenting those critical
    terms of the hedge instrument and that forecasted transactions
    have not changed. We also assess on a quarterly basis whether
    there have been adverse developments regarding the risk of a
    counterparty default. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of
    future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair
    value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and
    then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item
    affects net earnings. The ineffective portion of a
    derivatives change in fair value, if any, is reported in
    cost of products sold immediately. The net amount recognized in
    earnings during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, due to ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from the
    assessment of hedge effectiveness, was not significant.

 

    For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007, we have an
    obligation to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros,
    Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian
    Dollars and Korean Won and purchase Swiss Francs and sell
    U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January
    2008 through May 2010. The notional amounts of outstanding
    forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
    U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2007 were
    $1,244.6 million. The notional amounts of outstanding
    forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
    Swiss Francs at December 31, 2007, were
    $138.4 million. The fair value of outstanding derivative
    instruments recorded on the balance sheet at December 31,
    2007, together with settled derivatives where the hedged item
    has not yet affected earnings, was a net unrealized loss of
    $55.8 million, or $45.4 million net of taxes, which is
    deferred in other comprehensive income, of

    which, $44.9 million, or $38.2 million, net of taxes,
    is expected to be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve
    months.

 

    We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
    with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets
    and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
    entitys functional currency. As a result, any foreign
    currency translation gains/losses recognized in earnings under
    SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation
    are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

 

Other Comprehensive Income  Other
    comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and
    losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
    included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net
    earnings as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment
    to stockholders equity. Other comprehensive income is
    comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments,
    unrealized foreign currency hedge gains and losses, unrealized
    gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and
    amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and
    losses in actuarial assumptions.

Treasury Stock  We account for repurchases of
    common stock under the cost method and present treasury stock as
    a reduction of shareholders equity. We may reissue common stock
    held in treasury only for limited purposes.

 

Accounting Pronouncements  In June 2006, the
    FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FAS 109,
    Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48), to create a
    single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax
    positions. See our income tax disclosures in Note 11 for
    more information regarding the adoption of FIN 48.

 

    In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This Statement
    requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in
    the statement of financial position. SFAS No. 158 also
    requires recognition in other comprehensive income of certain
    gains and losses that arise during the period but are deferred
    under pension accounting rules, as well as modifies the timing
    of reporting and adds certain disclosures. The Statement
    provides recognition and disclosure elements to be effective as
    of the end of the fiscal year after December 15, 2006 and
    measurement elements to be effective for fiscal years ending
    after December 15, 2008. We adopted SFAS No. 158
    on December 31, 2006. See our pension and other
    postretirement disclosures in Note 10.

 

    In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),
    Share-Based Payment, which is a revision to
    SFAS No. 123. SFAS 123(R) requires all
    share-based payments to employees, including stock options, to
    be expensed based on their fair values. We adopted
    SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified
    prospective method and did not restate prior periods.

 

    In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. This Statement does not require any new
    fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure
    fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify
    the source of the information. SFAS No. 157 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position (FSP)
    No. SFAS 157-2,
    which delays the effective date of certain provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 relating to non-financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis
    until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements or
    results of operations.

 

    In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115 (SFAS No. 159).
    SFAS No. 159 creates a fair value option
    under which an entity may elect to record certain financial
    assets or liabilities at fair value upon their initial
    recognition. Subsequent changes in fair value would be
    recognized in earnings as those changes occur. The election of
    the fair value option would be made on a

    allow the financial statement user to understand the impact on
    earnings from the changes in the fair value.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our
    financial position or results of operations.

 

    In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    Business Combinations, which is a revision of
    SFAS 141. SFAS 141(R) will change the way in which we
    account for business combinations. The Statement introduces new
    purchase accounting concepts, expands the use of fair value
    accounting related to business combinations and changes the
    subsequent period accounting for certain acquired assets and
    liabilities, among other things. SFAS No. 141(R) will
    be applied prospectively on business combinations with
    acquisition dates in fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, and therefore this statement will not
    affect our financial statements for business combinations that
    preceded the effective date. For deferred tax assets and income
    tax reserves recorded as part of business combinations, these
    assets will be accounted for under SFAS 109 and FIN 48
    after the effective date regardless of the acquisition date.
    Therefore, if a remeasurement of those assets and liabilities is
    warranted after the effective date of this statement, it may
    affect our income tax expense in the period in which the
    remeasurement occurs.

 

    In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160,
    Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB 51. SFAS No. 160
    will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests,
    which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and
    classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160
    requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure
    requirements for existing minority interests.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    on or after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within
    those fiscal years. We do not expect that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION



 

    Our share-based payments primarily consist of stock options,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance
    shares and an employee stock purchase plan. We did not grant any
    RSUs or performance shares until 2006. Prior to January 1,
    2006, we accounted for share-based payments under APB Opinion
    No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees, and related Interpretations (APB
    25). Under APB 25, share-based payment expense was not
    significant because the exercise price of the stock options
    generally equaled the market price of the underlying stock on
    the measurement date of the stock options and we had awarded few
    shares of restricted stock and no RSUs or performance shares. No
    share-based payment expense was reflected in net income for the
    employee stock purchase plan under the provisions of APB 25, as
    the employee purchase price discount met the acceptable
    thresholds under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.

 

    We have elected the modified prospective method for adopting
    SFAS 123(R). Under the modified prospective method, the
    provisions of SFAS 123(R) apply to all share-based payments
    granted or modified after the date of adoption. For share-based
    payments granted prior to the date of the adoption, the
    unrecognized expense related to the unvested portion at the date
    of adoption will be recognized in net earnings under the grant
    date fair value provisions used for our pro forma disclosures
    under SFAS 123. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    share-based payment expense was $70.1 million or
    $48.1 million net of the related tax benefits. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, share-based payment expense was
    $76.0 million or $54.5 million net of the related tax
    benefits. Share-based payment expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 under APB 25 was not significant. The
    following is the pro forma expense disclosure under
    SFAS 123 for the year ended December 31, 2005 (in

    Prior to adopting SFAS 123(R), we classified all tax
    benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of
    non-qualified stock options as operating cash flows.
    SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from excess
    tax benefits (i.e., tax deductions realized for stock options
    exercised in excess of the tax benefit recognized on the related
    share-based payment expense) to be classified as financing cash
    flows.

 

Stock
    Options

 
 

    We had three equity compensation plans in effect at
    December 31, 2007: the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the
    2006 Plan), the TeamShare Stock Option Plan and the
    Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2006 Plan replaced
    the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2001 Plan), which
    by its terms expired in August 2006. Following stockholder
    approval of the 2006 Plan in May 2006, no further awards were
    granted under the 2001 Plan. However, vested and unvested stock
    options previously granted under the 2001 Plan remained
    outstanding

    as of December 31, 2007. We have reserved the maximum
    number of shares of common stock available for award under the
    terms of each of these plans and have registered
    52.9 million shares of common stock. The 2006 Plan provides
    for the grant of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock
    options, long-term performance awards in the form of performance
    shares or units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    stock appreciation rights. The Compensation and Management
    Development Committee of the Board of Directors determines the
    grant date for annual grants under our equity compensation
    plans. The date for annual grants under the 2006 Plan to our
    executive officers is expected to occur in February of each year
    following the earnings announcements for the previous quarter
    and full year. The TeamShare Stock Option Plan provides for the
    grant of non-qualified stock options and, in certain
    jurisdictions, stock appreciation rights, while the Stock Plan
    for Non-Employee Directors provides for awards of stock options,
    restricted stock and restricted stock units to non-employee
    directors. It has been our practice to issue shares of common
    stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued
    shares. The total number of awards which may be granted in a
    given year
    and/or over
    the life of the plan under each of our equity compensation plans
    is limited. At December 31, 2007, an aggregate of
    14.4 million shares were available for future grants and
    awards under these plans.

 

    Stock options granted to date under our plans generally vest
    over four years. We recognize expense related to stock options
    on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire
    award, less awards expected to be forfeited using estimated
    forfeiture rates. Stock options are granted with an exercise
    price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date
    of grant, except in limited circumstances where local law may
    dictate otherwise. In the past, certain options have had price
    thresholds, which affect exercisability. All such price
    thresholds have been satisfied. The total number of awards which
    may be granted in a given year
    and/or over
    the life of the plan under each of our stock option plans is
    limited to control dilution.

    We use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the
    fair value of our stock options. For stock options granted
    during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, expected
    volatility was derived from the implied volatility of our traded
    options that were actively traded around the grant date of the
    stock options with exercise prices similar to the stock options
    and maturities of over one year. In periods prior to
    January 1, 2006, expected volatility was derived based upon
    historical volatility of our common stock. The change in
    determining the expected volatility assumption was based upon
    our traded options with maturities over one year being more
    actively traded than in the past along with the guidance
    provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The expected term of the
    stock options has been derived from historical employee exercise
    behavior. The risk-free interest rate is determined using the
    implied yield currently available for zero-coupon
    U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the
    expected life of the options. A dividend yield of zero percent
    has been used as we have not paid a dividend since becoming a
    public company in 2001.

 

    The weighted average fair value of the options granted in the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    determined using the following assumptions:

    The weighted average fair value for options granted during 2007,
    2006 and 2005 were $22.60, $22.32 and $28.11, respectively. The
    total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    $124.5 million, $40.5 million and $109.2 million,
    respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, share-based payment expense related to stock options was
    $73.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively, or
    $50.4 million and $47.7 million net of the related tax
    benefits, respectively. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, the impact on basic and diluted EPS related to share-based
    payment expense on stock options was $0.19. Since prior to
    adoption of SFAS 123(R) the exercise price of stock options
    granted generally equaled the market price of the underlying
    stock on the measurement date, the expense related to stock
    options represents the impact of adopting this standard.

 

    Summarized information about outstanding stock options as of
    December 31, 2007 that are already vested and that we

    As of December 31, 2007, there was $111.4 million of
    unrecognized share-based payment expense related to nonvested
    stock options granted under our plans. That expense is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    2.8 years.

 

Performance
    Shares and RSUs

 
 

    We granted performance shares in 2006, the vesting of which
    depends on our achievement of objective performance targets over
    a three year period ended December 31, 2008. In addition,
    we granted performance-based RSUs in July 2007, the vesting of
    which depends on our achievement of objective performance
    targets over an 18 month period ended December 31,
    2008. To the extent our actual performance meets or exceeds the
    respective performance targets and the performance shares
    and/or RSUs
    are earned, they will generally vest at the end of the
    performance period ending December 31, 2008. We also
    granted RSUs in December 2007. These RSUs are not tied to our
    performance and will vest ratably on the first and second
    anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that the recipient
    is still our employee. Each of these awards will be converted
    into one share of our common stock upon vesting.

 

    A summary of nonvested performance share and RSU activity for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 is as follows (Performance

    The fair value of the awards was determined based upon the fair
    market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
    SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the number of
    performance shares and RSUs that will vest, and recognize
    share-based payment expense on a straight line basis over the
    requisite service period. As of December 31, 2007, we
    estimate that approximately 418,000 performance shares and RSUs
    will vest. If our estimate were to change in the future, the
    cumulative effect of the change in estimate will be recorded in
    that period. Based upon the number of performance shares and
    RSUs that we expect to vest, the unrecognized share-based
    payment expense as of December 31, 2007 was
    $20.4 million, and is expected to be recognized over a
    period of 1.8 years. For the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, pre-tax expense (income) related to these awards
    was $(3.3) million and $9.7 million, respectively, or
    $(2.3) million and $6.8 million net of the related tax
    benefits, respectively.

ACQUISITIONS



 

    We have made acquisitions that took place during the years 2007
    and 2006, certain of which are described below. These
    acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting pursuant to SFAS No. 141, Business
    Combinations (SFAS No. 141). Accordingly, the
    results of operations of the acquired companies have been
    included in our consolidated results of operations subsequent to
    the transaction dates, and the respective assets and liabilities
    of the acquired companies have been recorded at their estimated
    fair values in our consolidated statement of financial position
    as of the transaction dates, with any excess purchase price
    being allocated to goodwill. Pro forma financial information and
    other information required by SFAS No. 141 have not
    been included as the acquisitions did not have a material impact
    upon our financial position or results of operations.

 

ORTHOsoft
    Inc.

 
 

    In November 2007, we acquired ORTHOsoft Inc. (ORTHOsoft), a
    leader in computer navigation for orthopaedic surgery, in a cash
    transaction for an aggregate value of approximately
    $50 million. We recorded $31.4 million in

    In April 2007, we acquired Endius Incorporated (Endius), a
    privately held spinal products company based in Massachusetts,
    for an aggregate value of approximately $80 million in
    cash, before adjustments for debt repayment and other items. We
    recorded $42.3 million in goodwill in connection with the
    acquisition. Endius develops and manufactures minimally invasive
    spine surgery products, implants and techniques to treat spine
    disease. The acquisition of Endius has expanded our spine
    product portfolio to include innovative minimally invasive
    instruments and implants.

 

Musculoskeletal
    Management Systems, LLC

 
 

    In June 2006, we acquired Musculoskeletal Management Systems,
    LLC, more commonly known as the Human Motion Institute (HMI), a
    privately-held, hospital-focused consulting company based in
    Pennsylvania for a cash purchase price of $15.0 million. We
    recorded $13.0 million of goodwill in connection with the
    acquisition.

    During the year ended December 31, 2007, goodwill was
    reduced by $61.4 million related to the adoption of
    FIN 48 and increased by $83.6 million related to the
    acquisitions of Endius, ORTHOsoft and a foreign-based
    distributor. During the year ended December 31, 2006,
    goodwill was reduced by $51.5 million related to changes in
    the fair value estimates of Centerpulse. $46.0 million of
    this reduction was a decrease to the long term tax liability
    related to the expiration of the applicable statute of
    limitations. The remaining reduction primarily relates to the
    release of valuation allowances.

DEBT



 

    We have a five year $1,350 million senior credit agreement
    (the Senior Credit Facility). The Senior Credit
    Facility is a revolving, multi-currency, senior unsecured credit
    facility maturing November 30, 2012. Available borrowings
    under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2007, were
    $1,245.7 million. The Senior Credit Facility contains
    provisions whereby borrowings may be increased to
    $1,750 million and the maturity date may be extended for up
    to two one-year periods.

 

    We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the
    borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus
    an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior
    unsecured long-term credit rating and the amounts drawn under
    the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a
    fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The
    Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and
    negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured
    financing arrangement, including, among other things,
    limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
    Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to
    1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If we
    fall below an investment grade credit rating, additional
    restrictions would result, including restrictions on
    investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were
    in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit
    Facility as of December 31, 2007. Commitments under the
    Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a
    facility and a utilization fee.

 

    Outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2007 was
    $104.3 million and $99.6 million as of
    December 31, 2006. We had no current debt as of
    December 31, 2007 or 2006.

 

    We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
    $70.4 million.

 

    The weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility was 1.17 percent at
    December 31, 2007. Borrowings under the Senior Credit
    Facility at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are Japanese Yen
    based borrowings. We paid $8.5 million, $5.8 million
    and $15.3 million in interest during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

 

    Debt issuance costs of $22.8 million were incurred to
    obtain the Senior Credit Facility arrangement. These costs were
    capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the lives
    of the related facility. At December 31, 2007, unamortized
    debt issuance costs were $4.4 million.

RETIREMENT AND
    POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS



 

    We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain
    U.S. and Puerto Rico employees who were hired before
    September 2, 2002. Employees hired after September 2,
    2002 are not part of the U.S. defined benefit plans.
    Employees who had not become a member of the Puerto Rico defined
    benefit plans by March 1, 2004 are not part of the Puerto
    Rico defined benefit plans. The employees who are not
    participating in the defined benefit plans do receive additional
    benefits under our defined contribution plans. Plan benefits are
    primarily based on years of credited service and the
    participants average eligible compensation. In addition to
    the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit pension plans, we
    sponsor various
    non-U.S. pension
    arrangements, including retirement and termination benefit plans
    required by local law or coordinated with government sponsored
    plans.

 

    We also provide comprehensive medical and group life insurance
    benefits to certain U.S. and Puerto Rico eligible retirees
    who elect to participate in our comprehensive medical and group
    life plans. The medical plan is contributory, and the life
    insurance plan is non-contributory. No similar plans exist for
    employees outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Employees hired
    after September 2, 2002, are not eligible for retiree
    medical and life insurance benefits.

 

    We use a December 31 measurement date for our benefit plans.

 

    We adopted SFAS 158 (see Note 2  Accounting
    Pronouncements) as of December 31, 2006. The adoption of
    SFAS 158 had the following effects on our consolidated
    balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 as we recognized the
    funded status of our defined benefit and postretirement benefit
    plans with a corresponding adjustment to Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income:

    The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets is based
    on the period expected benefits will be paid and the historical
    rates of return on the different asset classes held in the
    plans. The expected long-term rate of return is the weighted
    average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset
    class. We believe that historical asset results approximate
    expected market returns applicable to the funding of a long-term
    benefit obligation.

    The U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement
    plans overall investment strategy is to maximize total
    returns by emphasizing long-term growth of capital while
    avoiding risk. We have established target ranges of assets held
    by the plans of 50 to 75 percent for equity securities and
    25 to 50 percent for debt securities. The plans strive to
    have sufficiently diversified assets so that adverse or
    unexpected results from one asset class will not have an unduly
    detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. The investments in
    the plans are rebalanced quarterly based upon the target asset
    allocation of the plans.

 

    The investment strategies of
    non-U.S. based
    plans vary according to the plan provisions and local laws. The
    majority of the assets in
    non-U.S. based
    plans are located in Switzerland based plans. These assets are
    held in trusts and are commingled with the assets of other Swiss
    companies, with representatives of all the companies making the
    investment decisions. The overall strategy is to maximize total
    returns while avoiding risk. The trustees of the assets have
    established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 30 to
    50 percent in debt securities, 20 to 37 percent in
    equity securities, 15 to 24 percent in real estate, 3 to
    15 percent in cash funds and 0 to 12 percent in other
    funds.

 
 

    As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our defined benefit
    pension plans assets did not hold any direct investment in
    Zimmer Holdings common stock.

 
 

    We expect that we will have no minimum funding requirements by
    law in 2008 for the qualified U.S. and Puerto Rico defined
    benefit retirement plans. However, we expect to voluntarily
    contribute between $20 million to $24 million to these
    plans during 2008. Additionally, we expect to contribute

    approximately $6 million million to our non-qualified

    non-U.S. defined
    benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $10 million

    We also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all
    of the U.S. and Puerto Rico employees and certain employees
    in other countries. The benefits of these plans relate to local

    A one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost
    trend rates would have no significant effect on the service and
    interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense
    and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The
    effect of a change in the healthcare cost trend rate is tempered
    by an annual cap that limits medical costs we pay.

 
 

    Amounts recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive
    income that will be recognized as part of our postretirement
    benefit expense during 2008 are not expected to be material.

 

    The benefits expected to be paid out in each of the next five
    years and for the five years combined thereafter are as follows

    Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
    used for income tax purposes. We have established valuation
    allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected
    future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the
    deduction or credit.

    The vast majority of the net operating loss carryover is
    available to reduce future federal and state taxable earnings.
    At December 31, 2007, these net operating loss carryovers
    generally expire within a period of 1 to 19 years.
    Valuation allowances for net operating loss carryovers have been
    established in the amount of $16.3 million and
    $10.4 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively. The tax credit carryovers
    are entirely available to offset future federal and state tax
    liabilities. At December 31, 2007, these tax credit
    carryovers generally expire within a period of 1 to
    15 years. We have established valuation allowances for
    certain tax credit carryovers in the amount of
    $20.2 million and $15.0 million at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The entire
    capital loss carryover is also available to reduce future
    federal taxable earnings; however, the capital loss carryover is
    subject to a valuation allowance and expires in 2 years.
    The remaining valuation allowances of $17.5 million and
    $8.4 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively, relate primarily to
    potential capital losses. We have established valuation
    allowances related to certain business combination transactions
    that, if not ultimately required, will result in a reduction of
    goodwill. These allowances were approximately $33.9 million
    and $29.0 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively.

 

    At December 31, 2007, we had an aggregate of approximately
    $493 million of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    that have been, or are intended to be, indefinitely reinvested
    for continued use in foreign operations. If the total
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted, a
    significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the
    allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practical for us to
    determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings.

Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements
    (Continued)


 

    In September 2007, we reached a settlement with the United
    States Department of Justice in an ongoing investigation into
    financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers
    and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. Under the terms of the
    settlement, we paid a civil settlement amount of
    $169.5 million and we recorded an expense in that amount.
    No tax benefit has been recorded related to the settlement
    expense due to the uncertainty as to the tax treatment. We
    intend to pursue resolution of this uncertainty with taxing
    authorities, but are unable to ascertain the outcome or timing
    for such resolution at this time. For more information regarding
    the settlement, see Note 15.

 

    In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48).
    FIN 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
    claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
    recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, we may
    recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
    it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
    technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
    the financial statements from such a position should be measured
    based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
    percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
    FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties on income taxes,
    accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.

 

    We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007.  Prior
    to the adoption of FIN 48 we had a long term tax liability
    for expected settlement of various federal, state and foreign
    income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary
    tax impact of these expected settlements of $102.1 million,
    as well as a separate accrued interest liability of
    $1.7 million. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48,
    we are required to present the different components of such
    liability on a gross basis versus the historical net
    presentation. The adoption resulted in the financial statement
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by
    $6.4 million as of January 1, 2007. The adoption
    resulted in this decrease in the liability as well as a
    reduction to retained earnings of $4.8 million, a reduction
    in goodwill of $61.4 million, the establishment of a tax
    receivable of $58.2 million, which was recorded in other
    current and non-current assets on our consolidated balance
    sheet, and an increase in an interest/penalty payable of
    $7.9 million, all as of January 1, 2007. Therefore,
    after the adoption of FIN 48, the amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits is $95.7 million as of January 1, 2007,
    of which $28.6 million would impact our effective tax rate,
    if recognized. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is
    $135.2 million as of December 31, 2007. Of this
    amount, $41.0 million would impact our effective tax rate,
    if recognized.

 

    A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

 



  
  
  
  
  





    Balance at January 1, 2007

    Increases related to prior periods

    (3.0


    )




 




 





    Balance at December 31, 2007



 


    $


    135.2


 




 




 





 

    We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings, which is consistent with
    the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods. As of
    January 1, 2007, we recorded a liability of
    $9.6 million for accrued interest and penalties, of which
    $7.5 million would impact our effective tax rate, if
    recognized. The amount of this liability is $19.6 million
    as of December 31, 2007. Of this amount, $14.7 million
    would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.

 

    We expect that the amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits will change in the next twelve months; however, we do
    not expect these changes will have a significant impact on our
    results of operations or financial position.

 

    The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for
    the year 2003 and onward with years 2003 and 2004 currently
    under examination by the IRS. It is reasonably possible that a
    resolution with the IRS for the years 2003 through 2004 will be
    reached within the next twelve months, but we do not anticipate
    this would result in any material impact on our financial
    position. In addition, for the 1999 tax year of Centerpulse,
    which we acquired in October 2003, one issue remains in dispute.
    The resolution of this issue would not impact our effective tax
    rate, as it would be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill.

 

    State income tax returns are generally subject to examination
    for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective
    return. The state impact of any federal changes remains subject
    to examination by various states for a period of up to one year
    after formal notification to the states. We have various state
    income tax returns in the process of examination, administrative
    appeals or litigation. It is reasonably possible that such
    matters will be resolved in the next twelve months, but we do
    not anticipate that the resolution of these matters would result
    in any material impact on our results of operations or financial
    position.

 

    Foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally
    ranging from 3 to 5 years. Years still open to examination
    by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include
    Australia (2003 onward), Canada (1999 onward), France (2005
    onward), Germany (2005 onward), Italy (2003 onward), Japan (2001
    onward), Puerto Rico (2005 onward), Singapore (2003 onward),
    Switzerland (2004 onward), and the United Kingdom (2005 onward).

    Our tax returns are currently under examination in various
    foreign jurisdictions. The major foreign tax jurisdictions under
    examination include Germany, Italy and Switzerland. It is
    reasonably possible that such audits will be resolved in the
    next twelve months, but we do not anticipate that the resolution
    of these audits would result in any material impact on our
    results of operations or financial position.

CAPITAL STOCK AND
    EARNINGS PER SHARE



 

    We have 2 million shares of Series A Participating
    Cumulative Preferred Stock authorized for issuance, none of
    which were outstanding as of December 31, 2007.

 

    The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is
    net earnings available to common stockholders. The denominator
    for basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of
    common shares outstanding during the period. The denominator for
    diluted earnings per share is weighted average shares
    outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options
    and other equity awards. The following is a reconciliation of
    weighted average shares for the basic and diluted share
    computations for the years ending December 31 (in millions):

    For the year ended December 31, 2007, an average of
    3.1 million options to purchase shares of common stock were
    not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as
    the exercise prices of these options were greater than the
    average market price of the common stock. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, an average of 7.6 million
    and 2.9 million options, respectively, were not included.

 

    In December 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock
    repurchase program of up to $1 billion through
    December 31, 2007. In December 2006, our Board of Directors
    authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to
    $1 billion through December 31, 2008. As of
    December 31, 2007 we had acquired approximately
    19,345,200 shares at a cost of $1,378.9 million,
    before commissions.

SEGMENT
    DATA



 

    We design, develop, manufacture and market reconstructive
    orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal
    implants, trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical
    products which include surgical supplies and instruments
    designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and
    post-operation rehabilitation. We also provide other healthcare
    related services. Revenue related to these services currently
    represents less than 1 percent of our total net sales. We
    manage operations through three major geographic
    segments  the Americas, which is comprised
    principally of the United States and includes other North,
    Central and South American markets; Europe, which is comprised
    principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and Africa;
    and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and
    includes other Asian and Pacific markets. This structure is the
    basis for our reportable segment information discussed below.
    Management evaluates operating segment performance based upon
    segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses
    pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses,
    share-based compensation expense, settlement, acquisition,
    integration and other expenses, inventory
    step-up,
    in-process research and development write-offs and intangible
    asset amortization expense. Global operations include research,
    development engineering, medical education, brand management,
    corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions, and
    U.S. and Puerto Rico based manufacturing operations and
    logistics. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from
    segment operating profit. Management reviews accounts
    receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, goodwill
    and intangible assets by reportable segment exclusive of U.S and
    Puerto Rico based manufacturing operations and logistics and
    corporate assets.

LEASES 



 

    Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating
    leases in effect as of December 31, 2007 were
    $35.4 million for 2008, $28.5 million for 2009,
    $21.5 million for 2010, $16.1 million for 2011,
    $12.5 million for 2012 and $20.3 million thereafter.
    Total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005 aggregated $37.1 million, $31.1 million
    and $27.9 million, respectively.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES 



 

Product Liability
    and Intellectual Property-Related Litigation

 
 

    As a result of our acquisition of Centerpulse in 2003, we
    acquired the entity involved in Centerpulses hip and knee
    implant litigation matter. The litigation was a result of a
    voluntary recall of certain hip and knee implants manufactured
    and sold by Centerpulse. On March 13, 2002, a
    U.S. Class Action Settlement Agreement was entered
    into by Centerpulse that resolved U.S. claims related to
    the affected products and a settlement trust was established and
    funded for the most part by Centerpulse. The court approved the
    settlement arrangement on May 8, 2002. Under the terms of
    the settlement agreement, we will reimburse the settlement trust
    a specified amount for each revision surgery over 4,000 and
    revisions on reprocessed shells over 64. As of December 31,
    2007, the claims administrator has received 4,133 likely valid
    claims for hips (cut-off date June 5, 2003) and knees
    (cut-off date November 17, 2003) and 200 claims for
    reprocessed shells (cut-off date September 8, 2004). We
    believe the litigation liability recorded as of
    December 31, 2007 is adequate to provide for any future
    claims regarding the hip and knee implant litigation.

 

    On February 15, 2005, Howmedica Osteonics
    Corp.  (Howmedica) filed an action against
    us and an unrelated party in the United States District Court
    for the District of New Jersey alleging infringement of
    U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934; 6,372,814; 6,664,308; and
    6,818,020. On June 13, 2007, the Court granted our motion
    for summary judgment on the invalidity of the asserted claims of
    U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934; 6,372,814; and 6,664,308 by
    ruling that all of the asserted claims are invalid for
    indefiniteness. We continue to believe that our defenses are
    valid and meritorious, and we intend to defend the Howmedica
    lawsuit vigorously.

 

    We are also subject to product liability and other claims and
    lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, for which
    we maintain insurance, subject to self-insured retention limits.
    We establish accruals for product liability and other claims in
    conjunction with outside counsel based on current information
    and historical settlement information for open claims, related
    fees and for claims incurred but not reported. While it is not
    possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases,
    it is the opinion of management that, upon ultimate resolution,
    these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

 

Government
    Investigations and Related Litigation

 
 

    In March 2005, the United States Department of Justice through
    the United States Attorneys Office in Newark, New Jersey
    commenced an investigation of us and four other orthopaedic
    companies pertaining to consulting contracts, professional
    service agreements and other agreements by which remuneration is
    provided to orthopaedic surgeons. On September 27, 2007, we
    reached a settlement with the government to resolve all claims
    related to this investigation. As part of the settlement, we
    entered into a settlement agreement with the United States of
    America through the United States Department of Justice and on
    behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of
    Health and Human Services (the OIG-HHS). In
    addition, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the
    DPA) with the United States Attorneys Office
    for the District of New Jersey (the
    U.S. Attorney) and a Corporate Integrity
    Agreement (the CIA) with the OIG-HHS. We did not
    admit any wrongdoing, plead guilty to any criminal charges or
    pay any criminal fines as part of the settlement.

 

    We settled civil and administrative claims related to the
    federal investigation for a cash payment to the United States
    government of $169.5 million. We recorded a
    $169.5 million expense during the third quarter of 2007 in
    connection with the settlement.

 

    Under the terms of the DPA, the U.S. Attorney filed a
    criminal complaint in the United States District Court for the
    District of New Jersey charging us with conspiracy to commit
    violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C.
    § 1320a-7b)
    during the years 2002 through 2006. The court deferred
    prosecution of the criminal complaint during the
    18-month
    term of the DPA. The U.S. Attorney will seek dismissal of
    the criminal complaint after the 18-month period if we comply
    with the provisions of the DPA. The DPA provides for oversight
    by a federally appointed monitor. Under the CIA, which has a
    term of five years, we agreed, among other provisions, to
    continue the operation of our enhanced Corporate Compliance
    Program, designed to promote compliance with federal healthcare
    program requirements, in accordance with the terms set forth in
    that agreement. We also agreed to retain an independent review
    organization (IRO) to perform annual reviews to
    assist us in assessing our compliance with the obligations set
    forth in the CIA to ensure that arrangements we enter into do
    not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Our obligation to retain
    an IRO is suspended during the 18-month term of the DPA. A
    material breach of the DPA or the CIA may subject us to further
    criminal or civil action and/or to exclusion by OIG-HHS from
    participation in all federal healthcare programs, which would
    have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements
    (Continued)


 

    In November 2007, we received a civil investigative demand from
    the Massachusetts Attorney Generals office seeking
    additional information regarding the financial relationships we
    publicly disclosed pursuant to the DPA with a number of
    Massachusetts healthcare providers. We are cooperating fully
    with the investigators with regard to this matter. We understand
    that similar inquiries were directed to other companies in the
    orthopaedics industry.

 

    In June 2006, we received a subpoena from the United States
    Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting that we
    produce documents for the period beginning January 2001 through
    June 2006, pertaining to an investigation of possible violations
    of federal criminal law, including possible violations of the
    antitrust laws, involving the manufacture and sale of
    orthopaedic implant devices. We are cooperating fully with
    federal authorities with regard to this matter. We understand
    that similar inquiries were directed to at least four other
    companies in the orthopaedics industry.

 

    On September 25, 2007, the Staff of the SEC informed us
    that it was conducting an informal investigation regarding
    potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the
    sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by
    companies in the medical device industry. We understand that at
    least four other medical device companies received similar
    letters. We are fully cooperating with the SEC with regard to
    this informal investigation.

 

    Following announcement of our entry into the DPA and CIA and
    commencement of the informal SEC investigation described above,
    two shareholder derivative actions were filed in Kosciusko
    Superior Court in Warsaw, Indiana. The first action, captioned
    Bottner v. Dvorak et al., was filed on
    October 16, 2007. The second action, captioned
    Capizzi v. Dvorak et al., was filed on
    October 30, 2007. On November 19, 2007, these two
    cases were consolidated under the caption In re Zimmer, Inc.
    Derivative Litigation. The plaintiffs seek to maintain the
    action purportedly on our behalf against all of our current
    directors and two former directors. On December 10, 2007,
    the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended derivative
    complaint, which claims, among other things, breaches of
    fiduciary duty by the individual defendants which allegedly
    allowed misconduct to occur, including alleged illegal payments
    to doctors, and caused us financial harm, including the cost of
    the settlement with the federal government described above. The
    plaintiffs do not seek damages from us, but instead request
    damages of an unspecified amount on our behalf. The plaintiffs
    also request that the court order (i) disgorgement of
    profits, benefits and other compensation obtained by the
    individual defendants and (ii) certain matters of corporate
    governance be placed before our stockholders for a vote. On
    January 16, 2008, we and the individual defendants filed
    separate motions to dismiss the complaint and memoranda in
    support. We and the individual defendants also filed a joint
    motion to stay discovery pending a ruling on the motions to
    dismiss. The motions are currently pending with the court.

Report
of Management
 
Management is
responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial data presented
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Financial Statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States and include amounts based on managements best estimates
and judgments. Management also is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting for Textron Inc. as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). With the participation of
our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control  Integrated Framework, we have concluded that Textron Inc. maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 29, 2007.
 
The independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Textron Inc. and has issued an attestation report on Textrons
internal controls over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, as
stated in its reports, which are included herein.
 
We conduct our
business in accordance with the standards outlined in the Textron Business Conduct
Guidelines, which are communicated to all employees. Honesty, integrity and
high ethical standards are the core values of how we conduct business. Every
Textron business prepares and carries out an annual Compliance Plan to ensure
these values and standards are maintained. Our internal control structure is
designed to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that assets are
safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The
internal control structure includes, among other things, established policies
and procedures, an internal audit function, and the selection and training of
qualified personnel. Textrons management is responsible for implementing
effective internal control systems and monitoring their effectiveness, as well
as developing and executing an annual internal control plan.
 
The Audit Committee of
our Board of Directors, on behalf of the shareholders, oversees managements
financial reporting responsibilities. The Audit Committee consists of four
directors who are not officers or employees of Textron and meets regularly with
the independent auditors, management and our internal auditors to review
matters relating to financial reporting, internal accounting controls and
auditing. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free and
full access to senior management and the Audit Committee.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
 
The Board of
Directors and Shareholders of Textron Inc.
 
We have audited Textron Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Textron Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
 
A companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
In our opinion,
Textron Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on the COSO
criteria.
 
We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 29, 2007 and December 30,
2006, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Shareholders
Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29,
2007 of Textron Inc. and our report dated February 13, 2008 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Schedule.
 
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Textron Inc.
 
We have audited the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Textron Inc. as of December 29,
2007 and December 30, 2006, and the related Consolidated Statements of
Operations, Shareholders Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 29, 2007. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule contained on page 77. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of Textron Inc.s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the
Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Textron Inc. at December 29,
2007 and December 30, 2006 and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29,
2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.
 
We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Textron Inc.s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 29, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2008 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.
 
As discussed in Note 5
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2007 Textron Inc. adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. 13-2, Accounting
for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income
Taxes Generated by a Leverage Lease Transaction, as discussed in Note 13 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2007 Textron Inc. adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, and as discussed in Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2006 Textron Inc. adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  An amendment of FASB
Statement Nos. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

Textron is segregated into a
  Manufacturing group and a Finance group as described in Note 1 to the
  Consolidated Financial Statements. The Finance groups pre-tax income in
  excess of dividends paid is excluded from the Manufacturing groups cash
  flows. All significant transactions between the borrowing groups have been
  eliminated from the consolidated column.

Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements
 
 
 
Note 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Principles of
Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation
Our Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of Textron Inc. and all of its
majority-owned subsidiaries, along with variable interest entities for which we
are the primary beneficiary.
 
Our financings are
conducted through two separate borrowing groups. The Manufacturing group
consists of Textron Inc., consolidated with the entities that operate in the
Bell, Cessna and Industrial segments, while the Finance group consists of the
Finance segment, comprised of Textron Financial Corporation and its
subsidiaries. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by
separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the
development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our
Finance group provides financial services. Due to the fundamental differences
between each borrowing groups activities, investors, rating agencies and
analysts use different measures to evaluate each groups performance. To
support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information
for each borrowing group within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Through our Finance group, we provide
diversified commercial financing to third parties. In addition, this group
finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment
manufactured by our Manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing.
In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash received from customers or
from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from
third parties. However, in the cash flow information provided for the separate
borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are
reflected based on the operations of each group. For example, when product is
sold by our Manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the Finance
group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing
activities as a cash outflow in the Finance groups statement of cash flows.
Meanwhile, in the Manufacturing groups statement of cash flows, the cash
received from the Finance group on the customers behalf is recorded within
operating cash flows as a cash inflow. Although cash is transferred between the
two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated
cash flows at the time of the original financing. These captive financing
activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are
reclassified or eliminated in consolidation.
 
In July 2007, our Board of Directors
approved a two-for-one split of our common stock. The financial statements for
all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the effect of the
split on share and per share amounts.
 
Use of
Estimates
We prepare our financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items,
long-term contracts, inventory valuation, residual values of leased assets,
allowance for credit losses on receivables, the amount and timing of future
cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans, product liability,
workers compensation, actuarial assumptions for the pension and postretirement
plans, future cash flows associated with goodwill and long-lived asset
valuations, and environmental and warranty reserves. Our estimates are based on
the facts and circumstances available at the time estimates are made,
historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends,
and our assessments of the probable future outcomes of these matters. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are
reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the
statement of operations in the period that they are determined.
 
Cash and Cash
Equivalents
Cash and cash
equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less.
 
Revenue
Recognition
We generally recognize revenue from the sale of
our products that are not under long-term contracts upon delivery. For
commercial aircraft, delivery is upon completion of manufacturing, customer
acceptance, and the transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership.
 
When a sale arrangement involves multiple
elements, such as sales of products that include customization and other
services, we evaluate the arrangement to determine whether there are separate
items that are required to be delivered under the arrangement that qualify as
separate units of accounting. The total fee from the arrangement is then
allocated to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value, taking
into consideration any performance, cancellation, termination or refund-type
provisions. Fair value generally is established for each unit of accounting
using the sales price charged when the same or similar items are sold
separately. We recognize revenue when the recognition criteria for each unit of
accounting are met.
 
43


 
Leases  Certain qualifying noncancelable aircraft
and other product lease contracts are accounted for as sales-type leases. Upon
delivery, we record the present value of all payments (net of executory costs
and any guaranteed residual values) under these leases as revenues, and the
related costs of the product are charged to cost of sales. For lease financing
transactions that do not qualify as sales-type leases, we record revenue as
earned over the lease period.
 
Long-Term
Contracts  Revenues
under long-term contracts are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position No. 81-1, Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. Under the
percentage-of-completion method, we estimate profit as the difference between
the total estimated revenue and cost of a contract. We then recognize that
estimated profit over the contract term based on either the costs incurred
(under the cost-to-cost method, which is typically used for development effort)
or the units delivered (under the units-of-delivery method, which is used for
production effort), as appropriate under the circumstances. Revenues under all
cost-reimbursement contracts are recorded using the cost-to-cost method.
Revenues under fixed-price contracts generally are recorded using the
units-of-delivery method; however, when the contracts provide for periodic
delivery after a lengthy period of time over which significant costs are
incurred or require a significant amount of development effort in relation to
total contract volume, revenues are recorded using the cost-to-cost method.
 
Our long-term contract profits are based on
estimates of total contract cost and revenue utilizing current contract
specifications, expected engineering requirements and the achievement of
contract milestones, including product deliveries. Certain contracts are
awarded with fixed-price incentive fees that also are considered when
estimating revenues and profit rates. Contract costs typically are incurred
over a period of several years, and the estimation of these costs requires
substantial judgment. We review and revise these estimates periodically
throughout the contract term. Revisions to contract profits are recorded when
the revisions to estimated revenues or costs are made. Anticipated losses on
contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become
probable and estimable.
 
Our Bell Helicopter
business has a joint venture with The Boeing Company (Boeing) to provide engineering,
development and test services related to the V-22 aircraft, as well as to
produce the V-22 aircraft, under a number of separate contracts with the U.S.
Government (the V-22 Contracts). This joint venture agreement creates
contractual, rather than ownership, rights related to the V-22.
Accordingly, we do not account for this joint venture under the equity method
of accounting. We account for all of our rights and obligations under the
specific requirements of the V-22 Contracts allocated to us under the joint
venture agreement. Revenues and cost of sales reflect our performance under the
V-22 Contracts with revenue on production lots, beginning with the seventh lot,
recognized using the units-of-delivery method. We include all assets used in performance
of the V-22 Contracts that we own, including inventory and unpaid receivables,
and all liabilities arising from our obligations under the V-22 Contracts in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
Finance
Revenues  Finance
revenues include interest on finance receivables, direct loan origination costs
and fees received. We recognize interest using the interest method to provide a
constant rate of return over the terms of the receivables. Revenues on direct
loan origination costs and fees received are deferred and amortized to finance
revenues over the contractual lives of the respective receivables using the
interest method. When receivables are sold or prepaid, unamortized amounts are
recognized in finance revenues. We generally suspend the accrual of interest
income for accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than three
months. In addition, detailed reviews of loans may result in earlier
suspension. We resume the accrual of interest when the loan becomes
contractually current and recognize the suspended interest income at that time.
Cash payments on nonaccrual accounts, including finance charges, generally are
applied to reduce loan principal.
 
Losses on
Finance Receivables
Provisions for losses
on finance receivables are charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain
the allowance at a level considered adequate to cover losses in the existing
receivable portfolio. We evaluate the allowance by examining current
delinquencies, characteristics of the existing accounts, historical loss experience,
underlying collateral value, and general economic conditions and trends. In
addition, for larger balance commercial loans, we consider borrower specific
information, industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows. Finance
receivables generally are written down to the fair value (less estimated costs
to sell) of the related collateral at the earlier of the date when the
collateral is repossessed or when no payment has been received for six months.
Finance receivables are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible.
 
Loan
Impairment
We periodically evaluate our non-homogeneous
loan portfolios for impairment. A loan is considered impaired when it is
probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement. We also identify loans that are
considered impaired due to the significant modification of the original loan
terms. These modified loans reflect deferred principal payments, generally at
market interest rates, and continue to accrue finance charges since collection
of principal and interest is not doubtful. We measure impairment by
 
44


 
comparing the fair value of a loan with its
carrying amount. Fair value is based on the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans
observable market price or, if the loan is collateral dependent, at the fair
value of the collateral, less selling costs. If the fair value of the loan is
less than its carrying amount, we establish a reserve based on this difference.
 
Securitized
Transactions
Securitized transactions involve the sale of
finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts. Through our Finance
group, we sell or securitize loans and leases and may retain an interest in the
assets sold in the form of interest-only securities, seller certificates, cash
reserve accounts, and servicing rights and obligations. These retained
interests are subordinate to other investors interests in the securitizations.
We do not provide legal recourse to third-party investors that purchase
interests in our securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the
retained interest-only securities, seller certificates and cash reserve
accounts. Gain or loss on the sale of the loans or leases depends, in part, on
the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer,
which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on
their relative fair values at the date of transfer.
 
Retained interests are
recorded at fair value in other assets. We estimate fair values based on the
present value of expected future cash flows using managements best estimates
of key assumptions  credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved. We review the fair values of the retained
interests quarterly using updated assumptions and compare such amounts with the
carrying value of the retained interests. When the carrying value exceeds the
fair value of the retained interests, we determine whether the decline in fair
value is other than temporary. When we determine that the value of the decline
is other than temporary, we write down the retained interests to fair value
with a corresponding charge to income. When a change in fair value of retained
interests is deemed temporary, we record a corresponding credit or charge to
other comprehensive income for any unrealized gains or losses.
 
Investments
We classify investments
in marketable equity securities as available for sale and record these
investments at fair value in other assets. Unrealized gains and losses related
to these investments are included in shareholders equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss. Investments in non-marketable equity
securities are accounted for under either the cost or equity method of
accounting. For investments in joint ventures for which we do not have control
or are not the primary beneficiary but where we do have the ability to exercise
significant influence over the ventures operating and financial policies, we
use the equity method.
 
Inventories
Inventories are stated
at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. We value our
inventories generally using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying inventories in the
U.S. We determine costs for our commercial helicopters on an average cost basis
by model considering the expended and estimated costs for the current
production release. Costs on long-term contracts represent costs incurred for
production, allocable operating overhead, advances to suppliers, and, in the
case of contracts with the U.S. Government, allocable research and development
and general and administrative expenses. Since our inventoried costs include
amounts related to contracts with long production cycles, a portion of these
costs is not expected to be realized within one year. Pursuant to contract
provisions, agencies of the U.S. Government have title to, or security interest
in, inventories related to such contracts as a result of advances,
performance-based payments and progress payments. Such advances and payments
are reflected as an offset against the related inventory balances.
 
Customer deposits are
recorded against inventory when the right of offset exists. All other customer
deposits are recorded in accrued liabilities.
 
Property,
Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost and are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method. Land
improvements and buildings are depreciated primarily over estimated lives
ranging from four to 40 years, while machinery and equipment are depreciated
primarily over one to 15 years. We capitalize expenditures for improvements
that increase asset values and extend useful lives.
 
Intangible and
Other Long-Lived Assets
At acquisition, we estimate and record the
fair value of purchased intangible assets primarily using discounted cash flow
analysis of anticipated cash flows reflecting incremental revenues and/or cost
savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset, reflecting market
participant assumptions. Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is
recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that
reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets
are consumed or otherwise realized. Approximately 40% of our gross intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method, with the
remaining assets, primarily customer agreements, amortized based on the cash
flow streams used to value the asset.
 
45


 
Long-lived assets,
including intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of
the asset held for use exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash
flows, the carrying value of the asset is generally written down to fair value.
Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value
less cost to sell. Fair value is determined using pertinent market information,
including estimated future discounted cash flows.
 
Goodwill
We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as
declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the
business climate, indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be
impaired. The reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete
financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for
businesses one level below that operating segment (a component), in which
case such component is the reporting unit. In certain instances, we have
aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit
based on similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is considered to be
potentially impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its
estimated fair value. Fair values are established primarily using a discounted
cash flow methodology. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on
the businesses strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. When
available, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate discounted cash
flow results.
 
Pension and
Postretirement Benefit Obligations
We maintain various
pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. These plans
include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are
calculated based on actuarial valuations. Key assumptions used in determining
these obligations and related expenses include expected long-term rates of
return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. We
evaluate and update these assumptions annually in consultation with third-party
actuaries and investment advisors. We also make assumptions regarding employee
demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the
rate of compensation increases.
 
We adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - An amendment of
FASB Statement Nos. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) on December 30, 2006. In
accordance with this Statement, we recognize the overfunded or underfunded
status of our pension and postretirement plans on the balance sheet and
recognize changes in the funded status of our defined benefit plans in comprehensive
income in the year in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses that are not
immediately recognized as net periodic pension cost are recognized as a
component of other comprehensive loss and amortized into net periodic pension
cost in future periods.
 
At December 30, 2006, the impact of
implementing SFAS No. 158 reduced total assets by $313 million, increased
total liabilities by $334 million and reduced shareholders equity (increase to
accumulated other comprehensive loss) by $647 million, net of tax. In addition,
we classified $92 million of pension and postretirement benefit liabilities as
current. The adoption did not affect our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption represents the
net unrecognized actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs (credits)
and unrecognized transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of
SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, all of which were
previously netted against the plans funded status in our balance sheet
pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 87. These amounts will be
subsequently amortized into net periodic pension cost in future periods.
 
Derivative
Financial Instruments
We are exposed to market risk primarily from
changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and securities pricing. We
do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. To manage the volatility relating to our exposures, we
net these exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural
offsets. For the residual portion, we enter into various derivative
transactions pursuant to our policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and hedging practices. All derivative instruments are reported on the balance
sheets at fair value. Designation to support hedge accounting is performed on a
specific exposure basis. For financial instruments qualifying as fair value
hedges, we record changes in fair value in income, offset, in part or in whole,
by corresponding changes in the fair value of the underlying exposures being
hedged. For cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of
derivatives (to the extent they are effective as hedges) in other comprehensive
(loss) income, net of deferred taxes. Changes in fair value of derivatives not
qualifying as hedges are recorded in income.
 
Foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars. Adjustments from currency rate
changes are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account in
shareholders equity until the related foreign entity is sold or substantially
liquidated. We use foreign currency financing transactions, including currency
swaps, to effectively hedge long-term investments in foreign operations with
the same corresponding currency. Foreign currency gains and losses on the hedge
of the long term investments are recorded in the cumulative translation
adjustment account with the offset recorded as an adjustment to the non-U.S.
dollar financing liability.
 
46


 
Fair Values of
Financial Instruments
The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, and variable-rate receivables and debt
approximates the carrying value of these financial instruments. We determine
the estimated fair values of other financial instruments, including debt,
equity and risk management instruments, using available market information and
valuation methodologies, primarily discounted cash flow analysis or independent
investment bankers.
 
Product and
Environmental Liabilities
We accrue product liability claims and related
defense costs on the occurrence method when a loss is probable and reasonably
estimable based on historical experience and the insurance coverage and
deductibles in effect at the date of the incident.
 
Liabilities for
environmental matters are recorded on a site-by-site basis when it is probable
that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated.
We estimate our accrued environmental liabilities using currently available
facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, which
all are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties. Our environmental
liabilities are undiscounted and do not take into consideration possible future
insurance proceeds or significant amounts from claims against other third
parties.
 
Research and
Development Costs
Research and development costs that are either
not specifically covered by contracts or represent our share under cost-sharing
arrangements are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs
incurred under contracts with others are reported as cost of sales over the
period that revenue is recognized.
 
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates
expected to be in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will
reverse or settle. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognize
future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent
that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits.
We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
income tax expense. We periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able
to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in
the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other
comprehensive income (loss), as appropriate. In assessing the need for a
valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable
temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years, the feasibility of
tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income.
 
Recently
Announced Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements.
SFAS No.157 replaces multiple existing definitions of fair value with a single
definition, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and
expands financial statement disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This
Statement applies only to fair value measurements that already are required or
permitted by other accounting standards and does not require any new fair value
measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective in the first quarter of 2008, and
we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.
 
In February 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115.
SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible assets and
liabilities at fair value with changes in value recognized in earnings. Fair
value treatment may be elected either upon initial recognition of an eligible
asset or liability or, for an existing asset or liability, if an event triggers
a new basis of accounting. SFAS No. 159 is effective in the first quarter
of 2008. We do not expect to elect to re-measure any of our existing financial
assets or liabilities under its provisions.
 
Note
2. Discontinued Operations
 
In August 2006, we completed the sale of our
Fastening Systems business to Platinum Equity, a private equity investment
firm, for approximately $613 million in cash and the assumption of $16 million
of net indebtedness and certain liabilities. There was no gain or loss recorded
upon completion of the sale. Prior to the consummation of the sale of the
Fastening Systems business, we recorded impairment and other charges of $120
million in 2006 and $387 million in 2005, which are described below. The
results of this business were accounted for as discontinued operations in the
Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented herein.
 
47


 
In September 2005,
our Board of Directors approved managements recommendation to explore
strategic alternatives for the Fastening Systems business. Based on the
approval of this recommendation and the likelihood of execution, we determined
that an impairment indicator existed for both the Fastening Systems goodwill
and its long-lived assets. In our assessment of potential impairment of the
goodwill, we estimated the fair value of the business based on current market
data. This fair value amount then was compared with the carrying amount of the
business. As the carrying amount exceeded the fair value, we then measured the
amount of goodwill impairment loss. The excess of the fair value of the
business over the fair value amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities
represents the implied fair value of goodwill. The carrying amount of the
goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill, resulting in an
impairment loss of $335 million in 2005.
 
Our Board of Directors
authorized the divestiture of the Fastening Systems business in December 2005,
and we recorded an after-tax charge of approximately $52 million. This charge
included $37 million related to previously deferred foreign currency
translation losses and $7 million in curtailment losses for employee retirement
plans. After these charges, we assessed the estimated fair value of the
business and determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value was
required at that time. In the second quarter of 2006, we recorded an additional
$120 million after-tax impairment charge to record the business at the
estimated fair value less cost to sell at that time based on offers received
from potential purchasers.
 
Operating results for
our discontinued businesses, primarily related to Fastening Systems, are as
follows:

Gain on disposal, net

the InteSys business in 2005.
 
We generally use a
centralized approach to the cash management and financing of our manufacturing
operations and, accordingly, do not allocate debt or interest expense to our
discontinued businesses. Any debt and related interest expense of a specific
entity within a business is recorded by the respective entity. General
corporate overhead previously allocated to the businesses for reporting
purposes is excluded from amounts reported as discontinued operations.
 
At December 29, 2007, assets and
liabilities of discontinued operations primarily relate to the sale of the
Fastening Systems business. For 2007, cash flows provided by operating and
investing activities are primarily related to taxes.
 
Note
3. Business Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 
2007 Business
Acquisitions
In 2007, we acquired
four businesses for cash totaling $1.1 billion. The results of operations for
these acquired businesses have been included in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations since the dates of each respective acquisition. Pro forma
information has not been included as the amounts are immaterial.
 
On November 14, 2007, we acquired a
majority ownership interest in United Industrial Corporation (UIC), a
publicly held company (NYSE: UIC), pursuant to a cash tender offer for $81 per
share. UIC operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, AAI Corporation (AAI).
AAI is a leading provider of intelligent aerospace and defense systems,
including unmanned aircraft and ground control stations, aircraft and satellite
test equipment, training systems and countersniper devices. UIC has been
integrated into our Bell segment, where we believe it adds important
capabilities to our existing aerospace and defense businesses and advances our
strategy to deliver broader and more integrated solutions to our customers. In
December, we completed the acquisition and obtained 100% ownership of UIC.
 
48


 
The following table
summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
from UIC as of November 14, 2007, the effective date of the acquisition:

In addition to the $655
million we paid for the net assets acquired on November 14, 2007, we paid
approximately $240 million to settle outstanding acquired debt and other
obligations and $157 million to purchase the minority interest in December.
 
The acquired intangible
assets represent primarily customer agreements and contractual relationships
with a weighted-average useful life of 13 years. We have allocated the purchase
price of this business to the estimated fair value of the net tangible and
intangible assets acquired, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Approximately
$64 million of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. These estimates are
preliminary as of the end of 2007 as we are awaiting the completion of the
identification and valuation of the intangible assets acquired. We expect these
analyses will be completed during the first half of 2008.
 
In 2007, we also acquired certain assets of
CAV-Air LLC, Columbia Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation and Paladin Tools.
CAV-Airs helicopter maintenance and service center was acquired by our Bell
segment. Columbia Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation produces high-performance,
single engine aircraft and has been integrated into our Cessna segment. Paladin
Tools is a provider of tools and accessories for the telecommunications
industry and has been integrated into our Industrial segment. We have recorded
$12 million of goodwill and $16 million in intangibles for these businesses.
 
2006 Business
Acquisitions
We acquired three businesses in 2006 for a total
cost of $338 million in the Bell segment and $164 million in the Finance
segment, all of which were paid for in cash. The operating results of these
businesses have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since
the date of each respective acquisition. These acquisitions include the
following:
 
·                  Overwatch
Systems (Overwatch), a developer and provider of intelligence analysis
software tools for the defense industry, was acquired on December 1.
·                  Innovative
Survivability Technologies, Inc., a supplier of innovative defensive
systems to military and homeland security customers, was acquired on July 19.
·                  Electrolux
Financial Corporations dealer inventory finance business, which provides
consumer appliance and electronics dealers with wholesale inventory financing,
was acquired on June 30.
 
In connection with these acquisitions in 2006,
we recorded $259 million in goodwill and $112 million in identifiable
intangible assets, primarily in the Bell segment. These amounts were adjusted
in 2007 to reflect the final fair value adjustments, which resulted in a reduction
of goodwill of $14 million, net of deferred taxes, and an increase in
intangible assets of $21 million. The adjusted intangible assets and
weighted-average amortization periods are as follows: $84 million in patents
and technology (15 years), $33 million in customer agreements (9 years) and $16
million in other intangible assets (4 years).

revenues we have appropriately recognized based on performance cannot be billed
yet under terms of the contract. Unbillable receivables within accounts
receivable totaled $166 million at December 29, 2007 and $144 million at December 30,
2006. Long-term contract receivables due from the U.S. Government exclude
significant amounts billed but unpaid due to contractual retainage provisions.

The above table does not
necessarily reflect future cash collections, as receivables often are repaid or
refinanced prior to contractual maturity.
 
Revolving
loans and distribution finance receivables generally mature within one to five
years. Revolving loans are secured by trade receivables, inventory, plant and
equipment, pools of vacation interval notes receivables, pools of residential
and recreational land loans, and the underlying property. Distribution finance
receivables generally are secured by the inventory of the financed distributor
and include floorplan financing for third-party dealers for inventory sold by
the E-Z-GO and Jacobsen businesses.
 
Installment
contracts and finance leases have initial terms ranging from two to 20 years
and primarily are secured by the financed equipment. Installment contracts
generally require the customer to pay a significant down payment, along with
periodic scheduled principal payments that reduce the outstanding balance
through the term of the loan. Finance leases include residual values expected
to be realized at contractual maturity. Leases with no significant residual
value at the end of the contractual term are classified as installment
contracts, as their legal and economic substance is more equivalent to a
secured borrowing than a finance lease with a significant residual value.
Contractual maturities for finance leases classified as installment contracts
in the table above represent the minimum lease payments, net of the unearned
income to be recognized over the life of the lease. Total minimum lease
payments and unearned income related to these contracts were $1.0 billion and
$315 million, respectively, at December 29, 2007 and $719 million and $222
million, respectively, at December 30, 2006. Minimum lease payments due
under these contracts for each of the next five years are as follows: $173
million in 2008, $149 million in 2009, $132 million in 2010, $141 million in
2011 and $106 million in 2012. Minimum lease payments due under finance leases
for each of the next five years are as follows: $156 million in 2008, $113
million in 2009, $75 million in 2010, $46 million in 2011 and $8 million in
2012.
 
Golf course and resort
mortgages are secured by real property and generally are limited to 75% or less
of the propertys appraised market value at loan origination. Golf course
mortgages have initial terms ranging from five to 10 years with amortization
periods from 15 to 25 years. Golf course mortgages, totaling $1.1 billion,
consist of loans with an average balance of $5 million and a weighted-average
remaining contractual maturity of five years. Resort mortgages generally
represent construction and inventory loans with terms up to five years.
 
Leveraged
leases are secured by the ownership of the leased equipment and real property
and have initial terms up to approximately 30 years. Leveraged leases reflect
contractual maturities net of contractual nonrecourse debt payments and include
residual values expected to be realized at contractual maturity.

In the first quarter of 2007,
we adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 13-2, Accounting for a Change
or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes
Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction (FSP 13-2). FSP 13-2 requires a
recalculation of returns on leveraged leases if there is a change or projected
change in the timing of cash flows related to income taxes generated by the
leveraged leases. The impact of any estimated change in projected cash flows
must be reported as an adjustment to the net leveraged lease investment and
retained earnings at the date of adoption. Our Finance group has leveraged
leases with an initial investment balance of $209 million that we estimate
could be impacted by changes in the timing of cash flows related to income
taxes. Upon the adoption, we reduced retained earnings for the $33 million
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and reduced our
investment in these leveraged leases by $50 million and deferred income tax
liabilities by $17 million.
 
Our Finance group manages and
services finance receivables for a variety of investors, participants and
third-party portfolio owners. The total managed and serviced finance receivable
portfolio, including owned finance receivables, was $12.5 billion at the end of
2007 and $11.5 billion at the end of 2006. Managed receivables include owned
finance receivables and finance receivables sold in securitizations and private
transactions where we retain some element of credit risk and continue to
service the portfolio.
 
Our finance receivables are
diversified across geographic region, borrower industry and type of collateral.
At December 29, 2007, 78% of our finance receivables were distributed
throughout the United States, compared with 83% at the end of 2006. The most
significant collateral concentration was in general aviation, which accounted
for 22% of managed receivables at the end of 2007 and 19% at the end of 2006.
Industry concentrations in the golf and vacation interval industries accounted
for 15% and 13%, respectively, of managed receivables at December 29,
2007, compared with 16% and 13%, respectively, at the end of 2006.
 
Transactions
between Finance and Manufacturing Groups
 
A portion of our Finance
groups business involves financing retail purchases and leases for new and
used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our Manufacturing group. The
captive finance receivables for these inventory sales that are included in our
Finance groups balance sheets are summarized below:

Operating agreements specify
that our Finance group has recourse to our Manufacturing group for certain
uncollected amounts related to these transactions. Our Manufacturing group has
established reserves for losses on its balance sheet within accrued and other
liabilities for the receivables it guarantees. These reserves are established
for amounts that potentially are uncollectible or if the collateral values are
considered insufficient to cover the outstanding receivable. If an account is
deemed uncollectible and the collateral is repossessed by our Finance group,
our Manufacturing group is charged for the deficiency. If the collateral is not
repossessed, the receivable is transferred from the Finance groups balance sheet
to the Manufacturing groups balance sheet. The Manufacturing group then is
responsible for any additional collection efforts. When this occurs, any
related reserve previously established by the Manufacturing group is
reclassified from accrued or other liabilities and netted against the
receivable or asset transferred from the Finance group.
 
In 2007, 2006 and 2005, our
Finance group paid the Manufacturing group $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $0.8
billion, respectively, related to the sale of Textron-manufactured products
that were financed by the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group also received
proceeds in those years of $27 million, $63 million and $41 million,
respectively, from the sale of equipment to the Finance group for use under
operating lease agreements. At the end of 2007 and 2006, the amounts guaranteed
by the Manufacturing group totaled $254 million and $335 million, respectively.
The Manufacturing group has total reserves for losses on these of $22 million
at the end of 2007 and $39 million at the end of 2006.
 
Impairment
 
Nonaccrual finance
receivables include accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than
three months for which the accrual of interest income is suspended. These
receivables are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable
to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement. Impaired accrual finance receivables represent loans with original
loan terms that have been significantly modified to reflect deferred principal
payments, generally at market interest rates, for which collection of principal
and interest is not doubtful. Past due loans for which the Finance group has
recourse to the Manufacturing group are not considered impaired in the table
below; these loans totaled $3 million and $2 million at the end of 2007 and
2006, respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired finance
receivables during 2007 was $84 million, compared with $142 million in 2006.
The impaired finance receivables and related reserves at the end of 2007 and
2006 are as follows:

Securitizations
 
Our Finance group sells
primarily its distribution finance receivables and general aviation loans to
qualified special purpose trusts through securitization transactions.
Distribution finance receivables represent loans secured by dealer inventories
that typically are collected upon the sale of the underlying product. Through a
revolving securitization, the proceeds from collection of the principal balance
of these loans are used by the trust to purchase additional distribution
finance receivables from us each month. This revolving securitization accounted
for approximately 93% of our securitization gains in 2007.
 
We
received proceeds from securitizations of $731 million in 2007, $50 million in
2006 and $361 million in 2005. For the revolving securitization, these proceeds
include only amounts received related to incremental increases in the level of
receivables sold into the securitization. Gains from securitizations were
approximately $62 million in 2007, $42 million in 2006 and $49 million in 2005.
At the end of 2007, $2.5 billion in securitized loans were outstanding, with
$17 million in past-due loans.
 
Generally,
we retain an interest in the assets sold in the form of servicing
responsibilities and subordinated interests, including interest-only
securities, seller certificates and cash reserves. At the end of 2007, we had
$203 million in retained interest recorded in other assets, which
 
53


 
included
$152 million in distribution finance receivables and $41 million in general
aviation loans. In comparison, retained interest totaled $179 million at the
end of 2006. Cash flows received on these retained interests totaled $71
million in 2007, $63 million in 2006 and $64 million in 2005. Key economic

We have incurred asset
retirement obligations primarily related to costs to remove and dispose of
underground storage tanks and asbestos materials used in insulation, adhesive
fillers and floor tiles. There is no legal requirement to remove these items,
and there currently is no plan to remodel the related facilities or otherwise
cause the impacted items to require disposal. As a result, these asset
retirement obligations are not estimable, and, in accordance with the
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, we have not recorded a liability.

* The weighted-average interest rates on these
borrowings before the effect of interest rate exchange agreements were 5.02% and

and 5.02% for the year 2006.
 
** At the
end of 2007 and 2006, variable-rate notes totaled $2.5 billion and $1.8

In 2007, the Finance group
issued $300 million of 6% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes,
which are unsecured and rank junior to all of its existing and future senior
debt. The notes mature on February 15, 2067; however, we have the right to
redeem the notes at par on or after February 15, 2017 and are obligated to
redeem the notes beginning on February 15, 2042. The Finance group has
agreed in a replacement capital covenant that it will not redeem the notes on
or before February 15, 2047 unless it receives a capital contribution from
the Manufacturing group and/or net proceeds from the sale of certain replacement
capital securities at specified amounts. Interest on the notes is fixed at 6%
until February 15, 2017 and floats at the three-month London Interbank
Offered Rate + 1.735% thereafter.
 
We have a policy of
maintaining unused committed bank lines of credit in an amount not less than
outstanding commercial paper balances. These facilities are in support of
commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only, and neither of these
primary lines of credit was drawn at December 29, 2007 or December 30,
2006. Our Manufacturing group had no commercial paper outstanding at December 29,
2007 or December 30, 2006 and had a weighted-average interest rate on its
commercial paper borrowings throughout the year of 5.20% in 2007 and 5.30% in
2006.

* Our Finance
group is permitted to borrow under this multi-year facility.
 
Lending agreements limit our
Finance groups net assets available for dividends and other payments to the
Manufacturing group to approximately $249 million of the Finance groups net
assets of $1.1 billion at the end of 2007. These lending agreements also
contain various restrictive provisions regarding additional debt (not to exceed
800% of consolidated net worth and qualifying subordinated obligations),
minimum net worth ($200 million), the creation of liens and the maintenance of
a fixed charges coverage ratio (no less than 125%).
 
The
following table shows required payments during the next five years on debt
outstanding at the end of 2007. The payment schedule excludes amounts that are
payable under or supported by the primary revolving credit facilities or
revolving lines of credit:

Note 9.
Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments
 
Fair Value
Interest Rate Hedges
 
We manage interest cost for
our Manufacturing group using a mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. To manage
this mix in a cost-efficient manner, we periodically enter into interest rate
exchange agreements to swap, at specified intervals, the difference between
fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon
notional principal amount. Generally, these hedges are considered perfectly
effective since the critical terms of the debt and the interest rate exchange
match and the other conditions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, are met. The mark-to-market values of both
the fair value hedge instruments and underlying debt obligations are recorded
as equal and offsetting amounts in interest expense. In December 2007, our
Manufacturing group terminated all outstanding interest rate exchange
agreements with a fair value liability of $2 million. The mark-to-market adjustment
to the carrying value of the underlying debt instrument will be amortized over
the remaining life. These agreements had a fair value liability of $8 million
at the end of 2006.
 
Our
Finance group enters into interest rate exchange agreements to mitigate
exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate receivables and debt
due to fluctuations in interest rates. By using these agreements, we are able
to convert our fixed-rate cash flows to floating-rate cash flows. At December 29,
2007, the Finance group had interest rate exchange agreements with a fair value
asset of $18 million designated as fair value hedges, compared with a $45
million liability at December 30, 2006.
 
56


 
Cash Flow
Interest Rate Hedges
 
We experience variability in
the cash flows we receive from our Finance groups investments in interest-only
securities due to fluctuations in interest rates. To mitigate our exposure to
this variability, our Finance group enters into interest rate exchange, cap and
floor agreements. The combination of these instruments converts net residual
floating-rate cash flows expected to be received by our Finance group to
fixed-rate cash flows. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are
recorded net of the income tax effect in other comprehensive income (loss). At December 29,
2007 and December 30, 2006, these instruments had an insignificant value.
We do not expect a significant amount of deferred gains, net of tax to be
reclassified to earnings related to these hedge relationships in 2008.
 
For
cash flow hedges, our Finance group recorded an after-tax loss of $3 million in
2007, an after-tax gain of $1 million in 2006 and an after-tax loss of $5
million in 2005 to accumulated other comprehensive loss with no impact to the
statements of operations. We have not incurred a significant net gain or loss
in earnings as the result of the ineffectiveness, or the exclusion of any
component from our assessment of hedge effectiveness, in 2007 or 2006.
 
Our exposure to loss from
nonperformance by the counterparties to our interest rate exchange agreements
at the end of 2007 is minimal. We do not anticipate nonperformance by
counterparties in the periodic settlements of amounts due. We currently
minimize this potential for risk by entering into contracts exclusively with
major, financially sound counterparties having no less than a long-term bond
rating of A, by continuously monitoring such credit ratings and by limiting
exposure to any one financial institution. The credit risk generally is limited
to the amount by which the counterparties contractual obligations exceed our
obligations to the counterparty.
 
Cash Flow
Foreign Exchange Rate Hedges
 
Since we manufacture and
sell our products in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed
to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary purpose of our
foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the volatility associated with
foreign currency purchases of materials, foreign currency sales of products,
and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We
primarily utilize forward exchange contracts and purchased options with
maturities of no more than 18 months that qualify as cash flow hedges. These
are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted
sales, inventory purchases and overhead expenses. The fair value of these
instruments was a $40 million and $13 million asset at the end of 2007 and
2006, respectively. At year-end 2007, $34 million in after-tax income was
reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss from qualifying cash flow
hedges. This income generally is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the
next 18 months as the underlying transactions occur.
 
Our Manufacturing group also
enters into certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not meet
hedge accounting criteria and primarily are intended to protect against
exposure related to intercompany financing transactions. The fair value of
these instruments at the end of 2007 and 2006 and the net impact of the related
gains and losses on selling and administrative expense in 2007 and 2006 were
not material.
 
Net
Investment Hedging
 
We
hedge our net investment position in major currencies and generate foreign
currency interest payments that offset other transactional exposures in these
currencies. To accomplish this, we borrow directly in foreign currency and
designate a portion of foreign currency debt as a hedge of net investments. We
also may utilize currency forwards as hedges of our related foreign net
investments. Currency effects of these hedges, which are reflected in the
cumulative translation adjustment account within other comprehensive income
(loss), produced a $24 million after-tax loss during 2007, leaving an
accumulated net loss balance of $43 million.
 
Stock-Based
Compensation Hedging
 
We
manage the expense related to stock-based compensation awards using cash
settlement forward contracts on our common stock. The use of these forward
contracts modifies compensation expense exposure to changes in the stock price
with the intent to reduce potential variability. The fair value of these
instruments at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 was a
receivable of $62 million and $24 million, respectively. Gains and losses on
these instruments are recorded as an adjustment to compensation expense when
the award is charged to expense. These contracts increased net income by $53
million in 2007, $21 million in 2006 and $8 million in 2005. Cash received or paid
on the contract settlement is included in cash flows from operating activities,
consistent with the classification of the cash flows on the underlying hedged
compensation expense.

Shareholders Equity
 
Capital
Stock
 
We
have authorization for 15 million shares of preferred stock with no par value
and 500 million shares of $0.125 par value common stock. Each share of $2.08
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A ($23.63 approximate
stated value; $11.00 liquidation value) is convertible into 8.8 shares of
common stock, and we can redeem it for $50 per share. At the end of 2007, 2006
and 2005, we had approximately 72,000; 147,000 and 153,000 shares,
respectively, of $2.08 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A
issued with approximately 72,000; 78,000 and 84,000 shares outstanding. Each
share of $1.40 Convertible Preferred Dividend Stock, Series B ($11.82
approximate stated value, preferred only as to dividends) is convertible into
7.2 shares of common stock, and we can redeem it for $45 per share. At the end
of 2007, 2006 and 2005, we had approximately 36,000; 527,000 and 534,000
shares, respectively, of $1.40 Convertible Preferred Dividend Stock, Series B
issued with approximately 36,000; 41,000 and 47,000 shares outstanding.
 
On July 18, 2007, our
Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our common stock effected in
the form of a 100% stock dividend and the retirement of 85 million shares of
treasury stock. The additional shares resulting from the stock split were
distributed on August 24, 2007 to shareholders of record on August 3,
2007. Prior period share data and per share data has been restated to reflect
this stock split.

Note 11.
Share-Based Compensation
 
Our 2007 Long-Term Incentive
Plan (the Plan) supersedes the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan and authorizes
awards to our key employees in the form of options to purchase our shares,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance stock awards and other awards. Options granted to purchase our
shares have a maximum term of 10 years and vest ratably over a three-year
period. Restricted stock unit awards granted vest one-third each in the third,
fourth and fifth year following the grant. A maximum of 12 million shares is
authorized for issuance for all purposes under the Plan, plus any shares that
become available upon cancellation, forfeiture or expiration of awards granted
under the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan. No more than 12 million shares may be
awarded pursuant to incentive stock options, and no more than 3 million shares
may be awarded pursuant to restricted stock or other full value awards
intended to be paid in shares. The Plan also authorizes performance share units
paid in cash. Payouts under performance share units vary based on certain
performance criteria measured over a three-year period. The performance share
units vest at the end of three years. We also provide share-based compensation
awards payable in cash, including retention awards to certain executives and
restricted stock units.
 
Through our Deferred Income
Plan for Textron Key Executives (the DIP), we provide participants the
opportunity to voluntarily defer up to 25% of their base salary and up to 100%
of annual and long-term incentive compensation and other compensation. Elective
deferrals may be put into either a stock unit account or an interest bearing
account. We generally contribute a 10% premium on amounts deferred into the stock
unit account. Executives who are eligible to participate in the DIP who have
not achieved and/or maintained the required minimum stock ownership level are
required to defer annual incentive compensation in excess of 100% of the
executives annual target into a deferred stock unit account and are not
entitled to the 10% premium contribution on the amount deferred. Participants
cannot move amounts between the two accounts while actively employed by us and
cannot receive distributions until termination of employment.
 
59


 
We adopted SFAS No. 123
(Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123-R), which replaces
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, in the first
quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123-R
requires companies to measure compensation costs for share-based payments to
employees, including stock options, at fair value and to expense such
compensation over the service period. Under the transition method, compensation
expense recognized in 2005 includes: a) compensation cost for all stock options
and restricted stock granted units payable in shares prior to but not yet
vested as of January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated
and recognized in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and b)
compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock units payable in
shares granted subsequent to January 1, 2005 and all share-based
compensation awards accounted for as liabilities, based upon the measurement
and recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123-R. For awards granted or
modified in 2005 and prospectively, compensation costs for awards with only
service conditions that vest ratably are recognized on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the
award. Compensation costs for awards granted prior to 2005 are recognized using
the attribution methods required under SFAS No. 123.

Share-based compensation
costs are reflected primarily in selling and administrative expenses.
Compensation expense includes approximately $23 million, $16 million and $17
million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing the attribution of
the fair value of options issued and the portion of previously granted options
for which the requisite service has been rendered. During 2006, we recorded
approximately $4 million of share-based award forfeitures related to
discontinued operations.
 
Stock
Options
 
The stock option
compensation cost calculated under the fair value approach is recognized over
the vesting period of the stock options. The weighted-average fair value of
options granted per share was $14, $12 and $10 for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. We estimate the fair value of options granted on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatilities are
based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock,
historical volatilities and other factors. We use historical data to estimate
option exercise behavior, adjusted to reflect anticipated increases in expected
life.

Restricted
Stock Units
The fair value of a restricted stock unit paid
in stock is based on the trading price of our common stock on the date of
grant, less required adjustments to reflect the fair value of the award as
dividends are not paid or accrued until the restricted stock unit vests. The
weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock units paid in stock
that were granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $45, $41 and $36 per
share, respectively.

As of December 29,

with unvested awards subject only to service conditions. As of December 29,
2007, we had not recognized $35 million of total compensation cost associated
with unvested share-based compensation awards subject to performance vesting
conditions. We expect to recognize compensation expense for each of these types
of awards over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.
 
The fair value of share-based
compensation awards accounted for as liabilities includes performance share
units, retention awards, restricted stock units payable in cash and DIP stock
unit awards. The fair value of these awards is based on the trading price of
our common stock, less adjustments to reflect the fair value of the award as
dividends are not paid or accrued until vested, and is remeasured at each
reporting period date.

12. Retirement Plans
 
Our defined benefit and defined contribution
plans cover substantially all of our employees. A significant number of our
U.S.-based employees participate in the Textron Master Retirement Plan (TMRP)
and the Bell Helicopter Textron Master Retirement Plan (BHTMRP), which are
subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA).
 
The TMRP is a defined benefit pension plan that
includes a new defined contribution component called the Retirement Account
Plan (RAP), which covers a portion of participants in the TMRP and BHTMRP,
and was created in 2007. Under the RAP, participants are eligible to receive 2%
of their annual compensation in contributions from Textron. Participants in the
RAP may not make contributions to the plan. Participants in the RAP may receive
pension benefits from the TMRP or the BHTMRP that are reduced by benefits
received under the RAP. We also have funded and unfunded defined benefit
pension plans that cover certain of our U.S. and foreign employees.
 
Several defined
contribution plans also are sponsored by our various businesses. The largest
such plan is the Textron Savings Plan (TSP), which is a qualified 401(k) plan
subject to ERISA in which a significant number of our U.S.-based employees
participate. Our defined contribution plans cost approximately $85 million in
2007, $50 million in 2006 and $45 million in 2005. The increase in cost in 2007
primarily relates to contributions of $24 million to the RAP and a higher
employee base, largely due to acquisitions.
 
We also provide postretirement benefits other
than pensions for certain retired employees in the U.S. and South Africa, which
include healthcare, dental care, Medicare Part B reimbursement and life
insurance benefits.

We estimate that the net loss and prior service
cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from other
comprehensive income into net periodic benefit costs in 2008 will be $17
million and $18 million, respectively. The estimated net loss and prior service
credit for postretirement benefits other than pensions that will be amortized
from other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit costs in 2008 will be
$16 million and $(4) million, respectively.

In October 2006, we transferred $281
million of plan assets from the TMRP to a plan established by the purchaser of
our Fastening Systems business. This settled our obligation to the U.S.-based
employees of this business. Upon this transfer, we recognized a settlement loss
of $35 million, which is included in discontinued operations. Obligations
related to the Fastening Systems business foreign plans were assumed by the
purchaser.

level. We estimate an initial prescription drug rate of 12% in 2007, which we
assume will decrease by 5% by 2015 and then remain at that level.

Pension Assets
 
We invest our pension assets with the objective
of achieving a total rate of return, over the long term, sufficient to fund
future pension obligations and to minimize future pension contributions. We are
willing to tolerate a commensurate level of risk to achieve this objective
based on the funded status of the plans and the long-term nature of our pension
liability. Risk is controlled by maintaining a portfolio of assets that is
diversified across a variety of asset classes, investment styles and investment
managers. All of the assets are managed by external investment managers, and
the majority of the assets are actively managed. Where possible, investment
managers are prohibited from owning our stock in the portfolios that they
manage on our behalf.
 
64


 
For U.S. plan assets,
comprising the majority of plan assets, asset allocation target ranges were
established consistent with the investment objectives, and the assets are
rebalanced periodically. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
was determined based on a variety of considerations, including the established
asset allocation targets and expectations for those asset classes, historical
returns of the plans assets and other market considerations. At December 29,
2007, the target allocation range is 44% to 70% for equity securities, 13% to
33% for debt securities, and 7% to 13% for each of real estate and other
alternative assets. For foreign plan assets, allocations are based on expected
cash flow needs and assessments of the local practices and markets. The
percentages of the fair value of total U.S. pension plan assets by major
category are as follows:

Estimated
Future Cash Flow Impact
 
Defined benefits under
salaried plans are based on salary and years of service. Hourly plans generally
provide benefits based on stated amounts for each year of service. Our funding
policy is consistent with applicable laws and regulations. In 2008, we expect
to contribute in the range of $53 million to $57 million to fund our qualified
pension plans and foreign plans. We do not expect to contribute to our other
postretirement benefit plans. The benefit payments provided below reflect
expected future employee service, as appropriate, that are expected to be paid,
net of estimated participant contributions, but do not include the Medicare Part D
subsidy we expect to receive. The benefit payments are based on the same
assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of fiscal 2007.
While pension benefit payments primarily will be paid out of qualified pension
trusts, we will pay postretirement benefits other than pensions out of our
general corporate assets as follows:

13. Income Taxes
 
We conduct business
globally and, as a result, file numerous consolidated and separate income tax
returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. For all of our U.S. subsidiaries, we file a consolidated federal
income tax return. Income from continuing operations before income taxes is as

The amount of income
taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax
authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the
potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We assess
our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to
examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and
information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions for which
it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we record the
amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement
with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
Interest and penalties are accrued, where applicable. If we do not believe that
it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax
benefit is recognized.
 
However, our future
results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax
liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations, new regulatory or
judicial pronouncements, or other relevant events. As a result, our effective
tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.
 
We adopted the provisions of FASB
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), at the beginning of
fiscal 2007, which resulted in an increase of approximately $22 million to our December 31,
2006 retained earnings balance. FIN 48 provides a comprehensive model for the
financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.
Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions for which reserves have been
established. Unrecognized state tax benefits and interest related to
unrecognized tax benefits are reflected net of applicable tax benefits.

A reconciliation of our
unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued interest, for 2007 is as follows:

At December 29,
2007, approximately $241 million of these unrecognized tax benefits, if
recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate in any future period.
The remaining $126 million in unrecognized tax benefits are related to
discontinued operations. We do not expect the amount of the unrecognized tax
benefits disclosed above to change significantly over the next 12 months.
 
In the normal course of business, we are subject
to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including major
jurisdictions such as Belgium, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the
United States. With few exceptions, we no longer are subject to U.S. federal,
state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 1997 in
these major jurisdictions.
 
During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized
approximately $28 million, $23 million and $14 million, respectively, in
interest. At the end of 2007 and 2006, we had $101 million and $77 million,
respectively, of accrued interest included in other liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Our income taxes
payable for federal and state purposes have been reduced by the tax benefits we
receive from employee stock options. The income tax benefits we receive for
certain stock options are calculated as the difference between the fair market
value of the stock issued at the time of exercise and the option price, tax
effected. These excess net tax benefits related to employee stock options are
presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as financing activities.
 
The undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries approximated $542 million at the end of
2007. We consider the undistributed earnings on which taxes have not previously
been provided to be indefinitely reinvested; therefore, tax is not provided on
these earnings. If the earnings on which tax has not been provided had been
distributed in 2007, our taxes, net of foreign tax credits, would have
increased by approximately $32 million.
 
Note
14. Special Charges
 
There were no special charges in 2007 or 2006.
In 2005, special charges totaled $118 million and included $112 million related
to the 2001 disposition of the Automotive Trim (Trim) business and $6 million
in restructuring expense in the Industrial segment.
 
In 2005, the $112
million in special charges that were incurred in connection with the
disposition of Trim included $91 million in impairment charges to write down
preferred stock acquired in the disposition and $21 million to cover exposures
related to certain guarantees for leases, environmental and workers
compensation matters.
 
Note
15. Commitments and Contingencies
 
We are subject to legal proceedings and other
claims arising out of the conduct of our business, including proceedings and
claims relating to private sector transactions; government contracts;
compliance with applicable laws and regulations; production partners; product
liability; employment; and environmental, safety and health matters. Some of
these legal proceedings and claims seek damages, fines or penalties in
substantial amounts or remediation of environmental contamination. As a
government contractor, we are subject to audits, reviews and investigations to
determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with
applicable regulatory requirements. Under federal government procurement
regulations, certain claims brought by the U.S. Government could result in our
being suspended or debarred from U.S. Government contracting for a period of
time. On the basis of information presently available, we do not believe that
existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has
challenged both the ability to accelerate the timing of tax deductions and the
amounts of those deductions related to certain leveraged lease transactions
within the Finance segment. These transactions, along with other transactions
with similar characteristics, have an initial investment of approximately $209
million. Resolution of these issues may result in an adjustment to the timing
of taxable income and deductions that reduce the effective yield of the leveraged
lease transactions. In addition, resolution of these issues could result in the
acceleration of cash payments to the IRS. At December 29, 2007, $180
million of deferred tax liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets related to these leases. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments
are inconsistent with the tax law in existence at the time the leases were
originated and intend to vigorously defend our position.
 
ARH Program  The Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH)
System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract is a cost plus incentive
fee contract under which our eligibility for fees is reduced as total contract
costs increase. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed certain phases of
the critical design review under the ARH SDD contract and determined the
initial production configuration of the aircraft, including aircraft
configuration changes required by the U.S. Government. Our cost estimates based
on this configuration, which included anticipated transition to production
costs, exceeded the fixed pricing contained in two options the U.S. Government
had under this program for the first two Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)
lots. The option for the first LRIP lot expired in 2006, while the option for
the second lot (for 18-36 aircraft) was set to expire in December 2007. At
that time, we were in discussions with the U.S. Government related to the
possible reinstatement of the first option, extension of the second option,
delivery schedule, number of units to be exercised under the options and
possible additional aircraft to be contracted, in addition to those under the
options, at revised pricing. At the end of 2006, due to the uncertainty of this
exposure and the ultimate outcome of our discussions with the U.S. Government,
we did not believe that a loss was probable under the guidelines established by
SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.
 
In March 2007, we received correspondence
from the U.S. Government that created uncertainty about whether it would proceed
into the production phase of the ARH program. Accordingly, we provided for
losses of $18 million in supplier obligations for long-lead component
production incurred at our own risk to support anticipated ARH LRIP contract
awards.
 
In the second quarter of 2007, the U.S. Army
agreed to re-plan the ARH program, and we reached a non-binding memorandum of
understanding (MOU) related to aircraft specifications, pricing methodology
and delivery schedules for initial LRIP aircraft. We also agreed to conduct additional
SDD activities on a funded basis. Based on the plan at that time and our
related estimates of aircraft production costs, including costs related to
risks associated with achieving learning curve and schedule assumptions, we
expected to lose approximately $73 million on the production of the proposed
initial LRIP aircraft. Accordingly, an additional charge of $55 million was
taken in the second quarter of 2007 for estimated LRIP contract losses.
 
In December 2007,
the U.S. Governments remaining option related to production of aircraft under
the original ARH program expired unexercised. We are continuing to restructure
the program through negotiations with the U.S. Government, including reducing
the number of units and modifying the pricing and delivery schedules previously
reached under the MOU. Based on the current status of these negotiations and
our contractual commitments with our vendors related to materials for the
anticipated production units we have procured at our risk, we have revised our
best estimate of the expected loss to $50 million, resulting in a $23 million
reduction of previously established reserves. We expect that the initial LRIP
contract awards will be finalized in mid-2008.
 
Environmental
Remediation
 
As with other industrial enterprises engaged in
similar businesses, we are involved in a number of remedial actions under
various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the environment that
impose liability on companies to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning
up, sites on which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed or released. Our
accrued environmental liabilities relate to disposal costs, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency oversight costs, legal fees, and operating and maintenance
costs for both currently and formerly owned or operated facilities.
Circumstances that can affect the reliability and precision of the accruals
include the identification of additional sites, environmental regulations,
level of cleanup required, technologies available, number and financial
condition of other contributors to remediation, and the time period over which
remediation may occur. We believe that any changes to the accruals that may
result from these factors and uncertainties will not have a material effect on
our financial position or results of operations.
 
69


 
Based upon information
currently available, we estimate that our potential environmental liabilities
are within the range of $42 million to $156 million. At the end of 2007,
environmental reserves of approximately $87 million, of which $10 million are
classified as current liabilities, have been established to address these
specific estimated potential liabilities. We estimate that we will likely pay
our accrued environmental remediation liabilities over the next five to 10
years. Expenditures to evaluate and remediate contaminated sites approximated
$7 million, $7 million and $6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
Leases
 
Rental expense approximated $107 million for
2007 and $89 million for each year in 2006 and 2005. Future minimum rental
commitments for noncancelable operating leases in effect at the end of 2007
approximated $66 million for 2008, $57 million for 2009, $47 million for 2010,
$36 million for 2011, $28 million for 2012 and a total of $173 million
thereafter.
 
Loan
Commitments
 
At December 29, 2007, our Finance group had
unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under $1.6 billion of
committed revolving lines of credit, compared with $1.3 billion at December 30,
2006. These loan commitments generally have an original duration of less than
three years and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since
many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire
unused. We are not exposed to interest rate changes on these commitments since
the interest rates are not set until the loans are funded.

Our customer-funded research and development
costs primarily are related to U.S. Government contracts, including the ARH,
V-22, VH-71 and H-1 development contracts.
 
As part of the
realignment of Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company LLC (BAAC) (see Note 18), Bell
Helicopter, Agusta S.p.A. and two of its affiliated companies (collectively, Agusta)
agreed to share certain Model BA609 development costs. On behalf of BAAC,
Agusta will incur development costs to enhance its investment in BAAC. Agusta
also may make cash contributions to reimburse portions of our development costs
incurred on behalf of BAAC. Based on development costs incurred, we received
$11 million, $19 million and $43 million in cash contributions from Agusta,
which were recorded in income in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
During 2005, Bell
Helicopter entered into four separate risk-sharing arrangements. Two of the
arrangements are with commercial participants in the development of the Bell
Model 429 aircraft. In 2007, one agreement was modified to reduce the amount of
cash and in-kind development efforts required from the participant, with
corresponding reductions in the entitlements the participant may obtain upon
future Model 429 production and sales. The arrangements require contributions
from the participants totaling $14 million, which are due once the development
effort reaches certain predetermined milestones, as well as in-kind development
contributions from one participant. The other two arrangements are with
Canadian governmental organizations. These arrangements, which currently
include the Model 429 aircraft and may potentially include certain future
aircraft, each require cash contributions of up to CAD 115 million from the
participants, based on a percentage of qualifying research and development
costs incurred.
 
Each of the participants under these
arrangements is entitled to payments from Bell Helicopter, with the commercial
participants also entitled to discounts, based on future sales of the Model 429
aircraft. In addition, there are certain requirements related to production of
future Model 429 aircraft in Canada. Based on the development activities
completed and costs incurred, we have recorded income of $22 million, $22
million and $35 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to these
arrangements.
 
In
2007, 2006 and 2005, we received, or were due to receive, $33 million, $41
million and $78 million, respectively, in cost reimbursements of company-funded
amounts from our risk-sharing partners. Based on these reimbursements, our net
company-funded costs totaled $332 million, $310 million and $248 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

* These
agreements include uncapped guarantees as described below.
 
Performance Guarantee
 
In 2004, through our
Bell Helicopter business, we formed AgustaWestlandBell LLC (AWB LLC) with
AgustaWestland North America Inc. (AWNA). This venture was created for the
joint design, development, manufacture, sale, customer training and product
support of the VH-71 helicopter, and certain variations and derivatives
thereof, to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the U.S.
Government. In March 2005, AWB LLC received a $1.2 billion cost
reimbursement-type subcontract from Lockheed Martin for the System Development
and Demonstration phase of the U.S. Marine Corps Helicopter Squadron Program.
We guaranteed to Lockheed Martin the due and prompt performance by AWB LLC of
all its obligations under this subcontract, provided that our liability under
the guaranty shall not exceed 49% of AWB LLCs aggregate liability to Lockheed
Martin under the subcontract. AgustaWestland N.V., AWNAs parent company, has
guaranteed the remaining 51% to Lockheed Martin. We have entered into
cross-indemnification agreements with AgustaWestland N.V. in which each party
indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements
that result from the indemnifying partys workshare under any subcontracts
received. AWB LLCs maximum obligation is 50% of the total contract value,
which equates to $613 million, for a maximum amount of our liability under the
guarantee of $300 million at December 29, 2007 through completion.
 
Guaranteed Minimum Resale
Contracts
 
We have a number of guaranteed minimum resale
value contracts associated with certain past aircraft sales. If the fair value
of an aircraft falls below a minimum guaranteed amount, we may be required to
make a future payment to the customer or provide a minimum trade-in value
toward a new aircraft. These agreements generally include operating
restrictions such as maximum usage over the contract period or minimum
maintenance requirements. We also have guaranteed the minimum resale value of
certain customer-owned aircraft anticipated to be traded in upon completion of
a model currently under development. These contracts expire as follows: $3
million in each year in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and $18 million in 2012.
 
Guarantees Related to
Dispositions
 
We indemnified the purchaser of
the Fastening Systems business for remediation costs related to pre-existing
environmental conditions to the extent they exist at the sold locations. We
have estimated the fair value of these indemnifications at approximately $28
million. Potential payments under these obligations are not capped and, as a
result, the maximum potential obligation cannot be determined. We also have
other obligations, some which are capped, arising from sales of certain other
businesses, including representations and warranties and related indemnities
for environmental, health and safety, and tax and employment matters. The
maximum potential payment related to other obligations that are capped is $17
million, while the maximum potential payment for the obligations that are not
capped cannot be determined. 
 
Loss-Sharing Agreements
 
In connection with the sale of
a note receivable in 2005, our Finance group has indemnified the purchaser
against potential losses in limited circumstances. The maximum potential
exposure of the indemnity is estimated to be $29 million, but, due to the
extremely low probability of occurrence and several other mitigating factors,
including a specific indemnification from the original note issuer, no
significant fair value has been attributed to the indemnity. 
 
71


 
Software Indemnifications
 
We enter into software license
agreements with customers through our Overwatch Systems business. These
software license agreements generally include certain provisions for
indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a
third partys intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any
material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any
liabilities related to such obligations. 
 
Forward Contract
 
We enter into a forward
contract in our common stock on an annual basis. The contract is intended to
hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stock-based incentive compensation
indexed to our stock. The forward contract requires annual cash settlement
between the counterparties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the
difference between the strike price and the prevailing common stock price. As
of December 29, 2007, the contract was for approximately 2.5 million
shares with a strike price of $47.28. The market price of the stock was $71.62
at December 29, 2007, resulting in a receivable of $62 million, compared
with a receivable of $24 million at December 30, 2006.
 
Warranty and
Product Maintenance Contracts
 
We provide limited warranty and product
maintenance programs, including parts and labor, for certain products for
periods ranging from one to five years. We estimate the costs that may be
incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such
costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect this
liability include the number of products sold, historical and anticipated rates
of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of our recorded
warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the
amounts as necessary.

and product maintenance liability are as follows:

Note 18.
Variable Interest Entities
 
In the normal course of
business, we have entered into various joint ventures or investments in other
entities that qualify as operating businesses. Generally, these ventures meet
the criteria for exclusion from the scope of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.
For those ventures or investments that are within the scope of this
Interpretation, we consolidate, as the primary beneficiary, the variable interest
entities in which we absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive
a majority of the entitys expected losses or both, as a result of contractual
or other financial interests in the entity.
 
BAAC is a joint venture established in 1998 between
our Bell Helicopter unit and a predecessor of Agusta S.p.A. to share certain
costs and profits for the joint design, development, manufacture, marketing,
sale, customer training and product support of the civil tiltrotor Model BA609
and, through December 2005, the commercial helicopter Model AB139. This
venture is a variable interest entity since it relies on its partners to fund
the development and to provide services for substantially all of the ventures
operations. We became the primary beneficiary of BAAC on December 20, 2005
when we obtained the controlling voting interest in the venture, along with the
right to absorb more than half of its expected losses and residual returns.
BAAC was consolidated prospectively in our financial statements as of December 20,
2005.
 
72




 
On December 20,
2005, we entered into an agreement with Agusta to realign BAAC. Under this
agreement, we sold our 25% profit interest in the Model AB139 medium twin
helicopter program to Agusta. Agusta assumed ownership of all aspects of the
Model AB139 program from BAAC, including all existing customer obligations. In
exchange for our interest, we received $10 million in cash, a $20 million note
and a note for contingent payments from Agusta based on future Model AB139
sales. We recognized a $30 million pre-tax gain upon the sale of our interest,
which is included in segment profit. The contingent receipts are expected to
begin with aircraft deliveries in 2008 and will be recorded into income
prospectively as the future sales occur. At the end of 2007 and 2006, Agustas
profit interest in the Model BA609 was approximately 32% and 30%, respectively.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Accounting PrinciplesThe financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a
  description of the significant accounting policies of Honeywell International Inc.
Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is
  maintained. Our consolidation policy requires the consolidation of entities where a controlling financial interest is obtained as well as consolidation of variable interest entities in which we bear a majority of
  the risk to the entities potential losses or stand to gain from a majority of the entities expected returns. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid, temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
InventoriesInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out or the average cost method and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic
  inventories.
InvestmentsInvestments in affiliates over which we have a significant influence, but not a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Other investments are carried
  at market value, if readily determinable, or at cost. All equity investments are periodically reviewed to determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other-than-temporary. Significant and sustained
  decreases in quoted market prices or a series of historic and projected operating losses by investees are strong indicators of other-than-temporary declines. If the decline in fair value is determined to be
  other-than-temporary, an impairment loss is recorded and the investment is written down to a new carrying value.
Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line
  method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 15 years for machinery and equipment. Statement of Financial Accounting
  Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) and FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47) require recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the
  retirement of tangible long-lived assets when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon adoption of FIN 47 on December 31, 2005, we recorded an increase of $14 million to property, plant and
  equipment and recognized an asset retirement obligation liability of $46 million. This resulted in the recognition of a non-cash charge of $32 million ($21 million after tax) that was reported as a cumulative
  effect of an accounting change. Upon initial recognition of a liability the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. See Note 11 and
  Note 17 for additional details.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of businesses
  acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill
  and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully
  recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This testing compares carrying values to fair values
  and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2007 and determined that there was no impairment as
  of that date. See Note 12 for additional details on goodwill balances.
51


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Other Intangible Assets with Determinable LivesOther intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are
  amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.
Long-Lived AssetsWe periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with determinable lives)
  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate events or changes in circumstances based on a number of factors
  including operating results, business plans and forecasts, general and industry trends and, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected
  future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized
  in earnings. We also continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets and periodically revise such estimates based on current events.
Sales RecognitionProduct and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or
  determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions
  segments, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments are recorded on a
  percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-
  term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair
  value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the
  sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.
Environmental ExpendituresEnvironmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past
  operations, and that do not provide future benefits, are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are recorded when environmental remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be
  reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as
  remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact
  of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss
  in excess of our recorded liabilities.
Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance RecoveriesHoneywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We
  recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we
  accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants. We also accrued for the probable
  value of future NARCO asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the NARCO trust as described in Note 21. In light of the inherent uncertainties
  in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018 under
  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS
52


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
No. 5). Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates. Since the fourth quarter of
  2006, we also accrue for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and
  anticipated resolution values in the tort system. In December 2006, we also changed our methodology for valuing Bendix pending and future claims from using average resolution values for the previous
  five years to using average resolution values for the previous two years. The claims filing experience and resolution data for Bendix related claims has become more reliable over the past several years.
  Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we updated our methodology for valuing Bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the past three years. We will continue to
  update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 21. We continually assess the
  likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each
  individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.
In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance
  recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency
  issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers.
Aerospace Sales IncentivesWe provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and
  braking system hardware and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives principally consist of free or deeply discounted products, but also include credits for future
  purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are expensed as provided. For aircraft manufacturers, incentives are recorded when the products are delivered; for airlines, incentives are
  recorded when the associated aircraft are delivered by the aircraft manufacturer to the airline.
Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in Cost of
  Products Sold and were $1,459, $1,411 and $1,072 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation PlansEffective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) requiring that compensation cost relating to
  share-based payment awards made to employees and directors be recognized in the financial statements. The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in
  Note 20 include non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the
  award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation cost using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
  Employees (APB No. 25), and related interpretations. We also followed disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148,
  Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. Under APB No. 25 there was no compensation cost recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for our stock option
  awards. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and
53


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and was not affected by our adoption of FAS No. 123R.
We adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method and, accordingly, the 2005 Consolidated Statement of Operations has not been restated to reflect the fair value method of
  recognizing compensation cost relating to stock options. Share-based compensation cost relating to stock options recognized in 2007 and 2006 is based on the value of the portion of the award that is
  ultimately expected to vest. SFAS No. 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on our
  historical rates of forfeiture. In our pro forma information required under SFAS No. 123 for 2005, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.
Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsWe sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. We also
  sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage to eligible retirees. For our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we use the market-related value of plan
  assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a three-year period. Further, net actuarial (gains) or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or
  the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) are recognized over a six year period. We adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
  (SFAS No. 158) as of December 31, 2006. See Note 22 for additional disclosures.
Foreign Currency TranslationAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end
  exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are
  remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these
  subsidiaries are included in earnings.
Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and
  commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through
  our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used
  for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes must be designated and effective as a
  hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying
  hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.
All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair
  values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are
  recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are
  classified consistent with the underlying hedged item.
Transfers of Financial InstrumentsSales, transfers and securitization of financial instruments are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for
  Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. We sell interests in
54


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The receivables are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time they are sold. The value assigned to our subordinated
  interests and undivided interests retained in trade receivables sold is based on the relative fair values of the interests retained and sold. The carrying value of the retained interests approximates fair value
  due to the short-term nature of the collection period for the receivables.
Income TaxesDeferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to
  reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it
  is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves
  estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for
  a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies.
  The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be
  impacted by changes to tax laws.
Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109) and in evaluating tax
  positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability
  threshold, as defined by FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by
  the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential
  outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount
  of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of
  common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.
Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
  affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically
  reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.
ReclassificationsCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FIN 48, which establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertain tax
  positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also
  provides guidance on derecognition, measurement classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Upon adoption as of January 1, 2007, we reduced our
  existing reserves for uncertain tax positions by $33 million, largely related to a reduction in state income tax matters, partially offset by a net increase for federal and international tax reserves.
55


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
This reduction was recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to shareowners equity. Additionally, we decreased a deferred tax asset and its associated valuation allowance by $44 million and increased
  goodwill by $1 million. See Note 6 for additional FIN 48 information and disclosure.
In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FIN 48-1 Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FSP FIN 48-1). FSP FIN 48-1 provides guidance on how to determine
  whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN 48-1 is effective retroactively to January 1, 2007. The implementation of this
  standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In September 2006, the FASB issued FSP AUG AIR-1 Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities (FSP AUG AIR-1). FSP AUG AIR-1 amends the guidance on the accounting for planned
  major maintenance activities; specifically it precludes the use of the previously acceptable accrue in advance method. FSP AUG AIR-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
  implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 establishes a common definition for
  fair value to be applied to US GAAP requiring use of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective
  for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-2 Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement 157 (FSP 157-2). FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for all nonfinancial assets
  and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
  The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. The implementation of
  this standard, for financial assets and financial liabilities, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many
  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
  beginning after November 15, 2007. The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In March 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-10 Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agreements (EITF 06-10). EITF 06-10
  provides guidance for determining a liability for postretirement benefit obligations as well as recognition and measurement of the associated asset on the basis of the terms of the collateral assignment
  agreement. EITF 06-10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results
  of operations.
In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF 06-11 Accounting for the Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards (EITF 06-11). EITF 06-11 provides that tax benefits associated
  with dividends on share-based payment awards be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
  2007. The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R provides revised guidance on how acquirers recognize and
56


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
measure the consideration transferred, identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 141R also expands required
  disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is
  currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 141R on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes requirements for ownership interests
  in subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company (sometimes called minority interests) be clearly identified, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity,
  but separate from the parents equity. All changes in the parents ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in
  deconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value. SFAS No. 160 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. However, presentation and
  disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on its consolidated financial position and
  results of operations.
Note 2Acquisitions and Divestitures
We acquired businesses for an aggregate cost of $1,190, $979 and $3,500 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. All of our acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
  accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Significant acquisitions made in these years are
  discussed below.
In July 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Dimensions International, a defense logistics business, for a purchase price of approximately $230 million. The purchase price for the
  acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned $21
  million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly contractual relationships. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated life of 5 years using straight-line and accelerated
  amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired approximating $180 million, was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax
  purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results
  from the acquisition date through December 31, 2007 are included in the Aerospace segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements.
In July 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Enraf Holding B.V., a provider of comprehensive solutions for the control and management of transportation, storage and blending operations
  in the oil and gas industry, for a purchase price of approximately $264 million, including the assumption of approximately $40 million of debt. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the
  tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned $90 million to identifiable intangible
  assets, predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated life of 8-15 years using straight-line and accelerated
  amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired approximating $167 million, was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill will be deducted over a 15
  year period for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of
  acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2007 are included in
57


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2007, the Company, specifically the Automation and Control Solutions segment, completed the acquisition of Maxon Corporation, a leading industrial combustion business, for a
  purchase price of approximately $185 million. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
  estimated fair values at acquisition date. The Company has assigned $88 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships and trademarks. These intangible assets are being
  amortized over their estimated lives which range from 6-10 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets
  acquired approximating $92 million, was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and, accordingly, results of
  operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2007 were not material to the consolidated
  financial statements.
In December 2007, the Company, specifically the Automation and Control Solutions segment, completed the acquisition of Hand Held Products, Inc. a privately held automatic identification and data
  collection company, for a purchase price of approximately $390 million. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
  assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned $114 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships and existing
  technology. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 6 to 10 years using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase
  price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired approximating $259 million, was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the
  purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31,
  2007 were not material to the consolidated financial statements.
In May 2006, the Company purchased Gardiner Groupe, a privately held company. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
  liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values and lives at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned $47 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships and
  trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 3 to 15 years using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase
  price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired approximating $130 million, was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the
  purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31,
  2006 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to the consolidated financial statements.
In March 2006, the Company purchased First Technology plc, a U.K. publicly listed company. The aggregate value of the purchase price was $723 million, including the assumption of approximately
  $217 million of outstanding debt and $23 million of transaction costs. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
  based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned $155 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly customer relationships, existing technology and
  trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives which range from 2 to 15 years using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. The excess of the purchase
  price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired approximating $432 million, was
58


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations are included in the consolidated
  financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results from the acquisition date through December 31, 2006 are included in the Automation and Control Solutions segment and were not material to
  the consolidated financial statements. During the year, the Company completed the sales of the First Technology Safety & Analysis business for $93 million and First Technology Automotive for $90 million
  which were accounted for as part of the purchase price allocation.
In November 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 50 percent of UOP LLC giving Honeywell full ownership of the entity. The aggregate value of the purchase price was approximately $825
  million, including the assumption of approximately $115 million of outstanding debt. The purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
  liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company has assigned $339 million to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly existing technology, which is being
  amortized over 15 years on a straight-line basis and trade names, which are not amortized. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired approximating $336
  million, was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. Following this acquisition, which is being accounted for by the purchase method, results of operations have been
  included into the Specialty Materials segment. Prior to that date, UOP results for the 50 percent share that the Company owned was included in equity income of affiliated companies.
On March 31, 2005, the Company purchased 100% of the issued and ordinary preference share capital of NOVAR plc (NOVAR) for $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired, which represented $2.4 billion for
  consideration of all outstanding shares and outstanding options to be exercised, net of the assumption of debt of $0.7 billion. Transaction costs related to this acquisition were $49 million. In December
  2005, we completed the sale of the Security Printing business to M&F Worldwide Corp. for $800 million in cash. In February 2006, we completed the sale of Indalex to an affiliate of private investment firm
  Sun Capital Partners, Inc. for approximately $425 million in cash. The Indalex business was classified as held for sale in our December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet and both the Indalex and
  Security Printing businesses have been presented as discontinued operations in our Statement of Operations for periods prior to the sale. Goodwill of approximately $1.3 billion was recognized and we
  allocated $261 million to other intangible assets (contractual customer relationships, existing technology and trademarks). These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives
  which range from 5 to 15 years using straight-line and accelerated amortization methods. In addition, accrued liabilities included $76 million of restructuring costs related to the integration of the NOVAR
  operations.
As of December 31, 2007, the purchase accounting for Dimensions International, Enraf Holding B.V., Hand Held Products, Inc. and Maxon Corporation are still subject to final adjustment primarily for
  useful lives, amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, for certain pre-acquisition contingencies, and for settlement of post closing purchase price adjustments.
In connection with all acquisitions in 2007, 2006 and 2005, the amounts recorded for transaction costs and the costs of integrating the acquired businesses into Honeywell were not material.
The pro forma results for 2007, 2006 and 2005, assuming these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year, would not be materially different from consolidated reported results.

In 2007, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $209 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 3,408 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in our
  Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace segments. Also, $18 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Transportation Systems and Aerospace segments, were
  returned to income in 2007 due mainly to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs and due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior
  severance programs.
In 2006, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $124 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 2,253 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our
  segments. Also, $22 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Aerospace, Transportation Systems and Specialty Materials segments were returned to income in 2006 due
  mainly to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs and due to
60


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior Aerospace severance programs.
In 2005, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $267 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 5,269 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our
  segments including the implementation of a new organizational structure in our Aerospace segment (substantially implemented in the third quarter of 2005) which reorganized our Aerospace businesses to
  better align with customer segments. Also, $25 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Corporate, Specialty Materials and Automation and Control Solutions segments
  were returned to income in 2005. The reversal of severance liabilities related to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs, excise taxes related to an executive severance amount
  previously paid which were determined to no longer be payable, and severance amounts previously paid to an outside service provider as part of an outsourcing arrangement which were refunded to
  Honeywell.
The following table summarizes the status of our total repositioning reserves.

The Companys effective tax rate increased by 0.7 of a percentage point in 2007 compared with 2006 due principally to the expiration of the tax benefit on export sales, partially offset by a decrease in
  the overall state and foreign effective tax rate and an increase in the tax benefit for the domestic manufacturing deduction and the favorable resolution of certain tax audits.

There were $32 million of U.S. federal tax net operating losses available for carryforward at December 31, 2007 which were generated by certain subsidiaries prior to their acquisition and have
  expiration dates through 2024. The use of pre-acquisition operating losses is subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. We do not anticipate that these limitations will affect utilization of
  the carryforwards prior to their expiration. Various subsidiaries have state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2007 with varying expiration dates through 2026. We have
  U.S. federal capital losses available for carryforward of $112 million which expire in 2011 and state capital losses available for carryforward of $286 million with varying expiration dates. We do not
  anticipate using these capital losses before expiration. We also have foreign net operating and capital losses of $2.6 billion which are available to reduce future income tax payments in several countries,
  subject to varying expiration rules.
We have state tax credit carryforwards of $42 million at December 31, 2007, including carryforwards of $29 million with various expiration dates through 2027 and tax credits of $13 million which are
  not subject to expiration. In addition, we have $5 million of foreign tax credits available for carryback or carryforward on the U.S. federal tax return at December 31, 2007 with varying expiration dates
  through 2013.
The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was decreased by $26 million in 2007 and increased by $39 and $139 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 decrease in the valuation
  allowance was primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowances related to state and foreign net operating losses partially offset by a valuation allowance against U.S. capital losses. The 2006 increase
  in the valuation allowance was primarily due to an increase in foreign net operating losses attributable to acquired businesses not expected to be realized and a partial valuation allowance against a
  deferred tax asset established in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 158 partially offset by a decrease in state tax net operating loss carryforwards (net of federal impact).
Federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective businesses.
  At December 31, 2007 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $4.1 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations. It is not practicable to
  estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be remitted, and foreign tax credits would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability.

As of January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as described in Note 1. As of that date, we had $744 million of unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, approximately $575 million would
  be recorded as a component of income tax expense. For year ended December 31, 2007, the Company decreased its unrecognized tax benefits by $78 million due to the tax benefit from the favorable
  resolution of tax audits, partially offset by foreign currency translation and additional reserves for various international and U.S. tax audit matters. The net decrease was recorded as a benefit to income tax
  expense. As of December 31, 2007 we had $666 million of unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, approximately $547 million would be recorded as a component of income tax expense.
The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits:

Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits for tax
  positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these
  examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Based on the number of tax years currently under audit by the relevant U.S federal,
  state and foreign tax authorities, the Company anticipates that several of these audits may be finalized in the foreseeable future. However, based on the status of these examinations, and the protocol of
  finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities, which could include formal legal proceedings, at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact of any amount of such changes, if any, to previously
  recorded uncertain tax positions.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Unrecognized tax benefits for the above listed examinations in progress were $502 million and $373 million as of January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, respectively. This decrease is primarily due
  to the settlement of tax examinations during the year.
Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $20 million for
  the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Accrued interest and penalties were $98 million and $118 million as of January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, respectively.

  during the period. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the number of stock options not included in the computation were 8,599,620, 22,749,056 and 17,793,385, respectively. These stock options were outstanding at
  the end of each of the respective years.

Trade Accounts Receivable includes $946 and $808 million of unbilled balances under long-term contracts as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These amounts are billed in accordance
  with the terms of the customer contracts to which they relate.
We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The sold receivables are over-collateralized by $101 million at December 31, 2007 and we retain a subordinated
  interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. New receivables are sold under the agreement as
  previously sold receivables are collected. Losses are recognized when our interest in the receivables are sold. The retained interests in the receivables are shown at the amounts expected to be collected
  by us, and such carrying value approximates the fair value of our retained interests. We are compensated for our services in the collection and administration of the receivables.

We maintain a $2.8 billion five year revolving credit facility with a group of banks, arranged by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P.Morgan Securities Inc. This credit facility contains a $700 million
  sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The $2.8 billion credit facility is maintained for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper. We had no borrowings
  outstanding or letters of credit issued under the credit facility at December 31, 2007.
The credit agreement does not restrict our ability to pay dividends and contains no financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary conditions or the occurrence of customary events of
  default contained in the credit agreement would prevent any further borrowings and would generally require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement. Such events of
70


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
default include: (a) non-payment of credit agreement debt, interest or fees; (b) non-compliance with the terms of the credit agreement covenants; (c) cross-default to other debt in certain circumstances; (d)
  bankruptcy; and (e) defaults upon obligations under Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment to lend additional funds or issue
  letters of credit under the agreement if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of our voting stock, or, during any 12-month period, individuals who were directors of
  Honeywell at the beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors (the Board).
Loans under the $2.8 billion credit facility are required to be repaid no later than May 14, 2012. We have agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.05 percent per annum on the aggregate commitment.
Interest on borrowings under the $2.8 billion credit facility would be determined, at Honeywells option, by (a) an auction bidding procedure; (b) the highest of the floating base rate publicly announced
  by Citibank, N.A., 0.5 percent above the average CD rate, or 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate; or (c) the Eurocurrency rate plus 0.15 percent (applicable margin).
The facility fee, the applicable margin over the Eurocurrency rate and the letter of credit issuance fee, are subject to change, based upon a grid determined by our long term debt ratings. The credit
  agreement is not subject to termination based upon a decrease in our debt ratings or a material adverse change.
In March 2007, the Company issued $400 million of 5.30% Senior Notes due 2017 and $600 million 5.70% Senior Notes due 2037 (collectively, the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured and
  unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross
  proceeds of $1 billion, offset by $12 million in discount and issuance costs.
In July 2007, the Company issued $500 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2009 and $400 million 5.625% Senior Notes due 2012 (collectively, the Senior Notes). The Senior Notes are senior
  unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywells existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all Honeywells subordinated debt. The offering
  resulted in gross proceeds of $900 million, offset by $3 million in discount and issuance costs.
In
    the first quarter of 2007, the Company repaid $350 million of its 7.0% Notes,
    primarily through issuance of the Notes. The proceeds from the Senior Notes
  were used to repay commercial paper.

We have entered into agreements to lease land, equipment and buildings. Principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years, and some contain renewal options subject to
  customary conditions. At any time during the terms of some of our leases, we may at our option
71


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
purchase the leased assets for amounts that approximate fair value. We do not expect that any of our commitments under the lease agreements will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
  results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
Rent expense was $365, $341 and $326 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Note 16Financial Instruments
Credit and Market RiskFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange
  rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our
  counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair
  value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial
  instruments to hedging activities.
We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. While concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts
  and notes receivable are considered minimal due to our diverse customer base, a significant portion of our customers are in the commercial air transport industry (aircraft manufacturers and airlines)
  accounting for approximately 21 percent of our consolidated sales in 2007. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single
  customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.
Foreign Currency Risk ManagementWe conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange
  rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our
  objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once
  these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound,
  Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi and Japanese yen.
We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on
  the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other/(Income) Expense. We hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally
  with forward contracts. Forward contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses similarly recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency
  denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged.
We partially hedge forecasted 2008 sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies with currency forward contracts. When a functional currency strengthens against nonfunctional
  currencies, the decline in value of forecasted non-functional currency cash inflows (sales) or outflows (purchases) is partially offset by the recognition of gains (sales) and losses (purchases), respectively,
  in the value of the forward contracts designated as hedges. Conversely, when a functional currency weakens against non-functional currencies, the increase in value of forecasted nonfunctional currency
  cash inflows (sales) or outflows (purchases) is partially offset by the recognition of losses (sales) and gains (purchases), respectively, in the value of the forward contracts

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. All open forward contracts mature by December 31, 2008.
At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had contracts with notional amounts of $3,295
    and $2,572 million, respectively, to exchange foreign currencies, principally
    the US dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican
    peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, and Japanese yen.
Commodity Price Risk ManagementOur exposure to market risk for commodity prices can result in changes in our cost of production. We primarily mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk
  through the use of long-term, fixed-price contracts with our suppliers and formula price agreements with suppliers and customers. We also enter into forward commodity purchase agreements with third
  parties designated as hedges of anticipated purchases of several commodities. Forward commodity purchase agreements are marked-to-market, with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings
  when the hedged transaction is recognized.
Interest Rate Risk ManagementWe use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to
  manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively
  changed $300 and $700 million, respectively, of fixed rate debt at an average rate of 6.01 and 6.38 percent, respectively, to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature through 2037.
Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the
  Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. Summarized below are the carrying values and fair values of our other financial instruments at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The fair values are
  based on the quoted market prices for the issues (if traded), current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturity and characteristics, or other valuation techniques, as appropriate.

Note 20Stock-Based Compensation Plans
We have stock-based compensation plans available to grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted units and restricted stock to key employees. Under
  the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (the Plan), which was approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners and became effective on April 24,
  2006, a maximum of 43 million shares of Honeywell common stock may be awarded. We expect that common stock awarded on an annual basis will be between 1.0 and 1.5 percent of total common stock
  outstanding. Following approval of the Plan on April 24, 2006, we will not grant any new awards under any previously existing stock-based compensation plans. Additionally, under the 2006 Stock Plan for
  Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (the Directors Plan), which was approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners and became effective on April 24, 2006,
  500,000 shares of Honeywell common stock may be awarded. The Directors Plan replaced the 1994 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc.
Stock OptionsThe exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation
  Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an
  expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options have generally vested over a three-year period and expire after ten years. Starting with 2007
  option grants the vesting period was extended to four years.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Honeywell
  common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The expected
  term represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect
  at the time of grant.
Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in operating results (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) under SFAS No. 123R in 2007 and 2006 was
  $65 and $77 million, respectively. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2007 and 2006 was $25 and $28 million, respectively. Compensation cost related to stock options recognized in
  our Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2007 and 2006 includes (1) compensation cost for stock option awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based on the grant-date
  fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123 and (2) compensation cost for stock option awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the grant-date
  fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R.

      Average remaining contractual life in years.



There were 37,902,956 and 42,416,585 options exercisable at weighted average exercise prices of $40.16 and $40.01 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There were 38,279,009 shares
  available for future grants under the terms of our stock option plans at December 31, 2007.
The total intrinsic value of options (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price of the options on the date of exercise) exercised during 2007 and 2006 was $281 and $92
  million, respectively. During 2007 and 2006, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $592 and $385 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $101 and
  $31 million, respectively. Consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 123R, in 2007 and 2006 we classified $86 and $31 million, respectively, of this benefit as a financing cash inflow in the
  Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and the balance was classified as cash from operations.
At December 31, 2007, there was $73 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.18
  years. The total fair value of options vested during 2007 and 2006 was $83 and $70 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock UnitsRestricted stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest. RSUs are issued to certain key employees at
  fair market value at the date of grant as compensation. RSUs typically become fully vested over periods ranging from three to seven years and are payable in Honeywell common stock upon vesting.
The following table summarizes information about RSU activity for the three years ended December 31, 2007:

As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately $153 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs granted under our stock plans which is expected to be
  recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.06 years. Compensation expense related to RSUs was $47, $29 and $24 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Non-Employee Directors PlanUnder the Directors Plan each new director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 shares of common stock, subject to specific restrictions.
The Directors Plan also provides for an annual grant to each director of options to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. Options have generally
  become exercisable over a three-year period and expire after ten years. Starting with 2007 option grants, the vesting period was extended to four years.
Note 21Commitments and Contingencies
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and
  procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in
  accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar
  businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past
  production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future.
79


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various
  remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the
  costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically
  as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the
  impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible
  environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors,
  including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of
  cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs:

Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the
  timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods
  recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
  position.
New Jersey Chrome SitesProvisions have been made in our financial statements for the estimated costs of the court-ordered excavation and transport for offsite disposal of approximately one million
  tons of chromium residue present at a predecessor Honeywell site located in Jersey City, New Jersey, known as Study Area 7 (SA 7). These expenditures have been and are expected to continue to be
  incurred evenly over a five-year period that started in April 2006. We do not expect implementation of this remedy to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of
80


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
operations, operating cash flows or financial position. Provision also has been made in our financial statements for the estimated costs of implementing related groundwater remedial plans approved by the
  court, as well as sediment remedial plans which are presently under review by the court in which litigation concerning the site is pending. The ultimate cost of remediating the river sediments may be
  reduced as numerous third parties could be responsible for an as yet undetermined portion of these costs.
The above-referenced site is the most significant of the twenty-one sites located in Hudson County, New Jersey that are the subject of an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) entered into with the
  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) in 1993. Remedial investigations and activities consistent with the ACO have been conducted and are underway at the other sites (the
  Honeywell ACO Sites). We have recorded reserves for the Honeywell ACO Sites where appropriate under the accounting policy described above.
On May 3, 2005, NJDEP filed a lawsuit in New Jersey Superior Court against Honeywell and two other companies seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages, and the
  reimbursement of unspecified total costs relating to sites in New Jersey allegedly contaminated with chrome ore processing residue. The claims against Honeywell relate to the activities of a predecessor
  company which ceased its New Jersey manufacturing operations in the mid-1950s. While the complaint is not entirely clear, it appears that approximately 100 sites are at issue, including 17 of the
  Honeywell ACO Sites, sites that the other two companies have agreed to remediate under separate administrative consent orders, as well as approximately 53 other sites (identified in the complaint as the
  Publicly Funded Sites) for which none of the three companies has signed an administrative consent order. In addition to claims specific to each company, NJDEP claims that all three companies should
  be collectively liable for all the chrome sites based on a market share theory. In addition, NJDEP is seeking treble damages for all costs it has incurred or will incur at the Publicly Funded Sites.
  Honeywell believes that it has no connection with the sites covered by the other companies administrative consent orders and, therefore, has no responsibility for those sites. At the Honeywell ACO Sites,
  we are conducting remedial investigations and activities consistent with the ACO; thus, we do not believe the lawsuit will significantly change our obligations with respect to the Honeywell ACO Sites.
Lawsuits have also been filed against Honeywell in the District Court under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by Jersey City and two of its municipal utilities seeking the cleanup
  of chromium residue at two Honeywell ACO Sites. In January 2008, Honeywell and Jersey City agreed to settle these claims, which settlement will become effective only upon the receipt of NJDEP
  approval of the remedial action workplan for these sites, classification by Jersey City of these and other related sites as an area in need of redevelopment and approval of the related redevelopment plan
  and agreement, and Court approval of this settlement. The remedial actions contemplated by this settlement are consistent with our recorded reserves.
RCRA litigation has also been filed against Honeywell by a citizens group and thirteen other defendants with respect to contamination on about a dozen of the Honeywell ACO Sites. For the reasons
  stated above, we do not believe this lawsuit will significantly change our obligations with respect to the Honeywell ACO sites.
Although it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate outcome or resolution of the litigation and administrative proceedings discussed above, we do not expect that these matters will have a
  material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. While we expect to prevail on or settle these claims, an adverse litigation outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
  results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.
Dundalk Marine Terminal, BaltimoreChrome residue from legacy chrome plant operations in Baltimore was deposited as fill at the Dundalk Marine Terminal (DMT), which is owned and operated
  by the Maryland Port Administration (MPA). Honeywell and the MPA have been sharing costs to
81


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
investigate and mitigate related environmental issues, and have entered into a cost sharing agreement under which Honeywell will bear a 77 percent share of the costs of developing and implementing
  permanent remedies for the DMT facility. The investigative phase (which began in April 2006) is expected to take approximately 18 to 36 months, after which the appropriate remedies will be identified and
  chosen. We have negotiated a Consent Decree with the MPA and Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) with respect to the investigation and remediation of the DMT facility. The Consent
  Decree is being challenged in federal court by BUILD, a Baltimore community group, together with a local church and two individuals (collectively BUILD). In October 2007, the Court dismissed BUILDs
  state law claims with prejudice and dismissed BUILDs RCRA claims regarding neighborhoods near the DMT facility without prejudice. BUILD has since sent notice letters indicating that they intend to re-
  file these latter claims, which we will continue to oppose. The Court is expected to schedule a hearing in the second quarter of 2008 on the Companys motion to dismiss BUILDs remaining claims on the
  grounds that MDE is diligently prosecuting the investigation and remediation of the DMT. We do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or
  operating cash flows. Given the scope and complexity of this project, it is possible that the cost of remediation, when determinable, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the
  periods recognized.
Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NYA predecessor company to Honeywell operated a chemical plant which is alleged to have contributed mercury and other contaminants to the Lake. In July 2005, the
  New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (the DEC) issued its Record of Decision with respect to remediation of industrial contamination in the Lake. In October 2006, Honeywell entered
  into a Consent Decree with the State of New York to implement the remedy set forth in the Record of Decision. In January 2007, the Consent Decree was approved by the United States District Court for
  the Northern District of New York.
The Record of Decision calls for a combined dredging/capping remedy generally in line with the approach recommended in the Feasibility Study submitted by Honeywell in May 2004. Based on
  currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants, we have accrued for our estimated cost of implementing the remedy set forth in the Record of Decision. Our
  estimating process considered a range of possible outcomes and the amounts recorded reflect our best estimate at this time. Given the scope and complexity of this project, it is possible that actual costs
  could exceed estimated costs by an amount that could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. At this time,
  however, we cannot identify any legal, regulatory or technical reason to conclude that a specific alternative outcome is more probable than the outcome for which we have made provisions in our financial
  statements. The DECs aggregate cost estimate, which is higher than the amount reserved, is based on the high end of the range of potential costs for major elements of the Record of Decision and
  includes a contingency. The actual cost of the Record of Decision will depend upon, among other things, the resolution of certain technical issues during the design phase of the remediation. We do not
  believe that this matter will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position. In December 2006, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service published notice of its intent to pursue
  natural resource damages related to the site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or timing of its assessments, which are typically lengthy processes lasting several years, or the amounts of or
  responsibility for these damages.
Asbestos Matters
Like many other industrial companies, Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos. We did not mine or produce asbestos, nor did we make or sell insulation products or
  other construction materials that have been identified as the primary cause of asbestos related disease in the vast majority of claimants. Products containing asbestos previously manufactured by
  Honeywell or
82


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
by previously owned subsidiaries primarily fall into two general categories: refractory products and friction products.
Refractory ProductsHoneywell owned North American Refractories Company (NARCO) from 1979 to 1986. NARCO produced refractory products (high temperature bricks and cement) that were
  sold largely to the steel industry in the East and Midwest. Less than 2 percent of NARCOS products contained asbestos.
When we sold the NARCO business in 1986, we agreed to indemnify NARCO with respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior to the sale (as defined in the sale
  agreement). NARCO retained all liability for all other claims. On January 4, 2002, NARCO filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S Bankruptcy Code.
As a result of the NARCO bankruptcy filing, all of the claims pending against NARCO are automatically stayed pending the reorganization of NARCO. In addition, the bankruptcy court enjoined both
  the filing and prosecution of NARCO-related asbestos claims against Honeywell. The stay has remained in effect continuously since January 4, 2002. In connection with NARCOs bankruptcy filing, we
  paid NARCOs parent company $40 million and agreed to provide NARCO with up to $20 million in financing. We also agreed to pay $20 million to NARCOs parent company upon the filing of a plan of
  reorganization for NARCO acceptable to Honeywell (which amount was paid in December 2005 following the filing of NARCOs Third Amended Plan of Reorganization), and to pay NARCOs parent
  company $40 million, and to forgive any outstanding NARCO indebtedness to Honeywell, upon the effective date of the plan of reorganization.
We believe that, as part of NARCO plan of reorganization, a trust will be established for the benefit of all asbestos claimants, current and future, pursuant to Trust Distribution Procedures negotiated
  with the NARCO Asbestos Claimants Committee and the Court-appointed legal representative for future asbestos claimants. If the trust is put in place and approved by the Court as fair and equitable,
  Honeywell as well as NARCO will be entitled to a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based
  on exposure to NARCO products to be made against the federally-supervised trust. Honeywell has reached agreement with the representative for future NARCO claimants and the Asbestos Claimants
  Committee to cap its annual contributions to the trust with respect to future claims at a level that would not have a material impact on Honeywells operating cash flows.
In November 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered an amended order confirming the NARCO Plan without modification and approving the 524(g) trust and channeling injunction in favor of NARCO and
  Honeywell. In December 2007, certain insurers filed an appeal from the Bankruptcy Courts amended confirmation order. This appeal is pending in the United States District Court for the Western District
  of Pennsylvania. No assurances can be given as to the time frame or outcome of this appeal. We expect that the stay enjoining litigation against NARCO and Honeywell to remain in effect during the
  pendency of these proceedings.
Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for settlement of pending and future NARCO-related asbestos claims as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 of $1.1 and $1.3 billion,
  respectively. The estimated liability for pending claims is based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements with approximately 260,000 current claimants, and an
  estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. Substantially all settlement payments with respect to current claims have been made as of December 31,
  2007. Approximately $95 million of payments due pursuant to these settlements is due only upon establishment of the NARCO trust.
The estimated liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against NARCO through 2018 and the aforementioned
  obligations to NARCOs parent. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections we
83


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond 2018 under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The estimate is based upon the disease criteria and
  payment values contained in the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures negotiated with the NARCO Asbestos Claimants Committee and the NARCO future claimants representative. Honeywell projected
  the probable number and value, including trust claim handling costs, of asbestos related future liabilities based upon experience of asbestos claims filing rates in the tort system and in certain operating
  asbestos trusts, and the claims experience in those forums. The valuation methodology also includes an analysis of the population likely to have been exposed to asbestos containing products,
  epidemiological studies to estimate the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases, NARCO claims filing history, the pending inventory of NARCO asbestos related claims and payment
  rates expected to be established by the NARCO trust. This methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous courts and is the same methodology that
  is utilized by an expert who is routinely retained by the asbestos claimants committee in asbestos related bankruptcies. In December 2006, as a result of significantly varying experiences of asbestos
  claims filing rates in the tort system (as a result of more clearly defined proof requirements) and in certain operating asbestos trusts, we updated the range of estimated liability for future NARCO-related claims. Such update resulted in a range of estimated liability for future claims of $743 to $961
  million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount. Accordingly, in December 2006 we recorded the minimum amount in the range which resulted in a
  reduction of $207 million in our estimated liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims. There has been no new data or developments during 2007 which would warrant a change in our estimated
  liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims.
As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our consolidated financial statements reflect an insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future NARCO-related asbestos
  claims of $939 and $955 million, respectively. This coverage reimburses Honeywell for portions of the costs incurred to settle NARCO related claims and court judgments as well as defense costs and is
  provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. At December 31, 2007, a significant
  portion of this coverage is with insurance companies with whom we have agreements to pay full policy limits based on corresponding Honeywell claims costs. We conduct analyses to determine the
  amount of insurance that we estimate is probable of recovery in relation to payment of current and estimated future claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our
  individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with
  our historical dealings with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers and various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs.
In the second quarter of 2006, Travelers Casualty and Insurance Company (Travelers) filed a lawsuit against Honeywell and other insurance carriers in the Supreme Court of New York, County of
  New York, disputing obligations for NARCO-related asbestos claims under high excess insurance coverage issued by Travelers and other insurance carriers. Approximately $340 million of coverage under
  these policies is included in our NARCO-related insurance receivable at December 31, 2007. Honeywell believes it is entitled to the coverage at issue and has filed counterclaims in the Superior Court of
  New Jersey seeking, among other things, declaratory relief with respect to this coverage. In the third quarter of 2007, Honeywell prevailed in the New York action on a critical choice of law issue
  concerning the appropriate method of allocating NARCO-related asbestos liabilities to triggered policies. The Courts ruling is subject to appeal. While Honeywell expects to prevail in this matter, an
  adverse outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period recognized but would not be material to our consolidated financial position or operating cash flows.
84


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. There is no
  assurance that the plan of reorganization will become final, that insurance recoveries will be timely or whether there will be any NARCO related asbestos claims beyond 2018. Given the inherent
  uncertainty in predicting future events, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors. Similarly we will reevaluate our projections concerning
  our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.
Friction ProductsHoneywells Bendix friction materials (Bendix) business manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. There is a group of
  existing and potential claimants consisting largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake
  replacements.
From 1981 through December 31, 2007, we have resolved approximately 113,000 Bendix related asbestos claims. Trials covering 126 plaintiffs resulted in 125 favorable verdicts and one mistrial.
  Trials covering ten individuals resulted in adverse verdicts; however, two of these verdicts were reversed on appeal, five are or shortly will be on appeal, and the remaining three claims were settled. The

Approximately 45 percent of the approximately 52,000 pending claims at December 31, 2007 are on the inactive, deferred, or similar dockets established in some jurisdictions for claimants who allege
  minimal or no impairment. The approximately 52,000 pending claims also include claims filed in jurisdictions such as Texas, Virginia, and Mississippi that historically allowed for consolidated filings. In
  these jurisdictions, plaintiffs were permitted to file complaints against a pre-determined master list of defendants, regardless of whether they have claims against each individual defendant. Many of these
  plaintiffs may not actually intend to assert claims against Honeywell. Based on state rules and prior experience in these jurisdictions, we anticipate that many of these claims will ultimately be dismissed.
  During 2006 approximately 16,000 cases were dismissed. More than 85 percent of these dismissals occurred in Mississippi as a result of judicial rulings relating to non-resident filings and venue. We
  continue to experience dismissals in this jurisdiction.
Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows:

It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future.
Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending and future Bendix related asbestos claims of $517 and $528 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
  respectively. Prior to December 2006, we only accrued for the estimated cost of pending Bendix related asbestos claims as we could not reasonably estimate losses which could arise from future Bendix
  related asbestos claims. Due to the steady three-year decline in the rate of Bendix related asbestos claims filed and reduced volatility in those rates, we felt that it was now possible to determine a
  reasonable estimate of the costs that would be incurred for claims filed over the next five years. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded a reserve of $335 million for the estimated cost
  of future Bendix related asbestos claims based on the historic claims filing experience, disease classifications, expected resolution values, and historic dismissal rates. In December 2007, we updated our
  analysis of the estimated cost of future Bendix related asbestos claims which resulted in a reduction of the reserve to $327 million at December 31, 2007. In December 2006, we also changed our
  methodology for valuing Bendix pending and future claims from using average resolution values for the previous five years to using average resolution values for the previous two years which resulted in a
  reduction of $118 million in the reserve for pending Bendix claims in the fourth quarter of 2006. The claims filing experience and resolution data for Bendix related claims has become more reliable over the
  past several years. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we updated our methodology for valuing Bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the past three years of
  data, which resulted in a $10 million reduction in the reserve for pending Bendix claims. We will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix
  claims during the fourth quarter each year.
The estimated liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. In light of the
  uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos
  claims beyond the next five years under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The estimate is based upon Bendix historical experience in the tort system for the three years ended December 31,
  2007 with respect to claims filing and resolution values. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims has been commonly accepted by numerous courts. It is similar to that used to
  estimate the future NARCO related asbestos claims liability.
Honeywell currently has approximately $1.9 billion of insurance coverage remaining with respect to pending and potential future Bendix related asbestos claims, of which $197 and $302 million are
  reflected as receivables in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This coverage is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance
  companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the liability for the
  estimated value of the underlying asbestos claims. The amount of the insurance receivable recorded is based on our ongoing analysis of the insurance that we estimate is probable of recovery. This
  determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, our interpretation of judicial
  determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. Insurance receivables are also recorded when structured insurance
  settlements provide for future fixed payment streams that are not contingent upon future claims or other events. Such amounts are recorded at the net present value of the fixed payment stream.
On a cumulative historical basis, Honeywell has recorded insurance receivables equal to approximately 50 percent of the value of the underlying asbestos claims recorded. However, because
86


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods, and insurance settlements, this rate is expected to decline for any future Bendix related asbestos
  liabilities that may be recorded. Future recoverability rates may also be impacted by numerous other factors, such as future insurance settlements, insolvencies and judicial determinations relevant to our
  coverage program, which are difficult to predict. Assuming continued defense and indemnity spending at current levels, we estimate that the cumulative recoverability rate could decline over the next five
  years to approximately 40 percent.
Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix related asbestos claims and Bendix related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five
  years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our
  consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the
  period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix related asbestos claims to have a
  material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change.

      estimated cost of future claims. In 2005, consists of gains from insurance settlements of $172 million principally related to a structured insurance settlement with a carrier which converted a policy into
      a future, fixed, non-contingent payment stream, and charges of $131 million for write-offs of certain amounts due from insurance carriers.

Other Matters
Allen, et, al. v. Honeywell Retirement Earnings PlanDuring the third quarter of 2007, we agreed to a settlement in principle with the plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit relating to allegations that,
  among other things, Honeywell impermissibly reduced the pension benefits of certain employees of the former Garrett Corporation (a predecessor entity by merger) when the plan was amended in 1983
  and failed to calculate certain benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan. Under the terms of the settlement, 18 of the 21 claims alleged by plaintiffs would be dismissed with prejudice in exchange
  for approximately $35 million, and the maximum aggregate liability for the remaining three claims would be capped at $500 million. During the third quarter of 2007, we recorded the $35 million settlement
  as part of pension expense (see Note 22). Any amounts payable, including the settlement amount, will be paid from the Companys pension plan. The definitive settlement agreement received final
  approval from the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in February 2008. We continue to expect to prevail on the remaining claims in light of applicable law and our substantial affirmative defenses,
  which have not yet been considered by the Court. Accordingly, we do not believe that a liability is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable with respect to these claims and we have
88


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
not recorded a provision for the remaining claims in our financial statements. Although we expect to prevail on all three of the remaining claims, an adverse ruling on one or more of these claims could
  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods recognized. We do not believe that an adverse outcome in this matter would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
  operating cash flows or consolidated financial position.
We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to
  commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for
  any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable
  losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.
Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation, we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters. Considering our
  past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
  Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary
  requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating
  cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.

We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the
  date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on
  contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. The
  following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees:

Note 22Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits for substantially all U.S. employees are
  provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. U.S. defined benefit pension plans comprise 73 percent of our projected benefit obligation. Non-U.S.
  employees, who are not U.S. citizens, are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. Non-U.S.
  defined benefit pension plans comprise 27 percent of our projected benefit obligation.
We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage to eligible retirees. Our retiree medical plans mainly cover U.S. employees who retire with
  pension eligibility for hospital, professional and other medical services. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell after January 1, 2000 are not eligible to participate in our retiree
  medical and life insurance plans. Most of the U.S. retiree medical plans require deductibles and copayments, and virtually all are integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are generally required
  based on coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. Honeywell has limited its subsidy of its retiree medical plans to a fixed-dollar amount for substantially all future retirees and for almost half of its
  current retirees. This cap of retiree medical benefits under our plans limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded.
  Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow.
As discussed in Note 1, we adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires that we recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of our defined benefit pension and
  other postretirement benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheet and recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service
  costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets were also derecognized
  upon adoption of the new standard. The adjustment for SFAS No. 158 affected our 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:

To select a discount rate for our retirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a
  portfolio of double A rated fixed-income debt instruments. We use the average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other
  postretirement benefit obligation is lower due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.
Our expected rate of return on plan assets of 9 percent is a long-term rate based on historic plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset
  mix considerations. The expected rate of return is a long-term assumption and generally does not change annually.
Mortality assumptions for our U.S. benefit plans were updated as of December 31, 2005 using the RP2000 Mortality table for all participants.
Pension Benefits
Included in the aggregate data in the tables below are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets, as well as plans with
  projected benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows:

Our asset investment strategy focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual
  invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer-term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, our U.S. investment policy requires that our U.S. Master
  Retirement Trust be invested as follows: (a) no less than 5 percent be invested in fixed income securities; (b) no more than 10 percent in private real estate investments; and (c) no more than 18 percent in
  other investment alternatives involving limited partnerships of various types. There is no stated limit on investments in publicly-held U.S. and international equity securities. Our non-U.S. investment
  policies are different for each country, but the long-term investment objectives remain the same.
Our general funding policy for qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2007 and 2006, we made voluntary contributions of $42 and
  $68 million, respectively, to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily for government contracting purposes. Assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with our expected rate of 9 percent
  in 2008 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, we would not be required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans for the foreseeable future. We expect to make voluntary
  contributions of approximately $40 million in cash in 2008 to certain of our U.S. plans for government contracting purposes. We also expect to contribute approximately $125 million in cash in 2008 to our
  non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. These contributions do not reflect benefits to be paid directly from Company assets.
Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

Other Postretirement Benefits
FASB Staff Position No. 106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP No. 106-2) provides guidance
  on accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription
  drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to that offered by Medicare Part D. The impact of

Employee Savings Plans
We sponsor employee savings plans under which we match, in the form of our common stock, savings plan contributions for certain eligible U.S. employees. Shares issued under the stock match
  plans were 3.7, 4.5 and 4.1 million at a cost of $199, $179 and $153 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Note 23Segment Financial Data
We globally manage our business operations through four reportable operating segments serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services, control, sensing and security
  technologies for buildings, homes and industry, automotive products and chemicals. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource
  allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. Our four reportable segments are as follows:


 



      
 
 
 

      Aerospace is organized by customer end-market (Air Transport and Regional, Business and General Aviation and Defense and Space) and provides products and services which include auxiliary
      power units; propulsion engines; environmental control systems; engine controls; repair and overhaul services; hardware; logistics; electric power systems; flight safety, communications, navigation,
      radar and surveillance systems; aircraft lighting; management and technical services; advanced systems and instruments; and aircraft wheels and brakes.


 




 

 
 

Automation and Control Solutions includes Products (controls for heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification and home automation; advanced software applications for home/
      building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for measuring pressure, air flow, temperature and electrical current; security, fire and gas detection; access
      control; video surveillance; and remote patient monitoring systems); Building Solutions (installs, maintains and upgrades systems that keep buildings safe, comfortable and productive); and Process
      Solutions (provides a full range of automation and control solutions for industrial plants, offering advanced software and automation systems that integrate, control and monitor complex processes in
      many types of industrial settings).


 




 

 
 

Specialty Materials includes fluorocarbons, specialty films, advanced fibers, customized research chemicals and intermediates, electronic materials and chemicals, and catalysts and adsorbents.

      filters, spark plugs, and cleaners, waxes and additives; and brake hard parts and other friction materials).



The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1. Honeywells senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment profit is
  business unit income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expenses, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, pension and other postretirement benefits
  (expense), stock option expense, repositioning and other charges and accounting changes. Intersegment sales approximate market prices and are not significant. Reportable segment data follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
TO THE
 BOARD OF
 DIRECTORS AND
 SHAREOWNERS OFHONEYWELL
 INTERNATIONAL
 INC.:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1.) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Honeywell International Inc. and its
  subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
  generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2.) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
  information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
  financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
  (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
  the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
  these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the
  standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
  statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining,
  on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
  overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
  necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for income tax uncertainties in 2007, the manner in which it accounts for stock-
  based compensation and defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in 2006 and the manner in which it accounts for conditional asset retirement obligations in 2005.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
  external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
  of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
  to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
  authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys
  assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
  risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The consolidated statements of cash flows include the activities of the Medical Imaging business.
The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.  88 
Table of ContentsNote 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements, prepared in conformity with United States (U.S.) generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP), include the accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS, the Company or Bristol-Myers Squibb) and all of its controlled majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions, based on complex judgments that are considered reasonable, that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most
significant assumptions are employed in estimates used in determining values of intangible assets, restructuring charges and accruals, sales rebate and return accruals, legal contingencies, tax assets and tax liabilities, stock-based compensation
costs, retirement and postretirement benefits (including the actuarial assumptions), financial instruments with no observable market quotes, as well as in estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy. Actual results may or may not
differ from estimated results. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, when
title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Generally, revenue is recognized at time of shipment. However, in the case of certain sales made by the Nutritionals and ConvaTec segments and certain
non-U.S. businesses within the Pharmaceuticals segment, revenue is recognized on the date of receipt by the purchaser. In accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return
Exists, revenues are reduced at the time of recognition to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience and business trends. Additionally, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01-9,
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products), provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for discounts, rebates and estimated sales allowances based on
historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. Such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue. In the case of new products for which the product introduction is not an extension of an existing line of product, where the Company determines that there are not products in a similar therapeutic category, or where the Company determines
the new product has dissimilar characteristics with existing products such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until
the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. Sales Rebate and Return Accruals Medicaid rebate accruals were $125 million and $137 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively; Women, Infants and Children (WIC) rebate
accruals were $198 million and $230 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively; sales return accruals were $178 million and $221 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively; and managed health care rebate and other
contractual discount accruals were $134 million and $111 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These and other rebate accruals were established in the same period the related revenue was recognized, resulting in a reduction to
sales and the establishment of a liability, which is included in accrued liabilities. An accrual is recorded based on an estimate of the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a rebate or return. Prime vendor charge-back accruals,
established in a similar manner, are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable and were $70 million and $63 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred
taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in
deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Companys assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation
allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the
long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. As of December 31, 2007 and
2006, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $3,483 million and $3,154 million, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $1,950 million and $625 million, respectively.  89 
Table of ContentsNote 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  The Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets at December 31, 2007 related to U.S.
foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,140 million, U.S. research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $275 million and charitable contribution carryforwards of $80 million. The charitable contribution carryforwards expire in
varying amounts beginning in 2009, while the foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2012. The foreign tax credit and research credit have been reduced due to derecognition under Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Realization of these credits and charitable contribution carryforwards is
dependent on generating sufficient domestic taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company
anticipates increasing its level of domestic profitability over time by undertaking actions such as its Productivity Transformation Initiative (PTI), increasing its biologics manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and implementing tax planning
strategies. While increasing domestic profitability will likely cause the Companys effective tax rate to increase, it will also further enhance the Companys ability to utilize its foreign tax credit, research tax credit and
charitable contribution carryforwards.The Company conducts business in various countries throughout the world and is subject to tax in
numerous jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company files a significant number of tax returns that are subject to examination by various Federal, state and local tax authorities. Tax examinations are often complex, as tax
authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by the Company and may require several years to resolve. The Company establishes liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but
not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid, and may need to be adjusted over time as more information
becomes known. The effect of changes in estimates related to contingent tax liabilities is included in the effective tax rate reconciliation in Note 8. Income Taxes. In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, which, in the case of the Company, was effective as of January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 requires that all tax positions be evaluated using a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized
in the financial statements are recorded as adjustments to income taxes payable or receivable, or adjustments to deferred taxes, or both. FIN No. 48 also requires expanded disclosure at the end of each reporting period including a tabular
reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement, the Company recognized $27 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, which
was accounted for as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings. In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FIN No. 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48, which is effective
retroactively to January 1, 2007. FSP FIN No. 48-1 provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The adoption of FSP FIN
No. 48-1 did not have any effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. As previously reported, upon the adoption
of FIN No. 48, the Companys total amount of uncertain tax benefits as of January 1, 2007, net of deferred income tax benefits, and excluding interest and penalties, was $960 million. In addition, the Company derecognized on adoption
$180 million of unrecognized tax benefits, for which there is no tax rate impact when settled. As such, the gross unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 were $1,140 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $14.1 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which taxes have not been
provided as the Company has invested or expects to invest these undistributed earnings permanently offshore. If, in the future, these earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the
foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and
cash equivalents primarily consist of bank deposits, time deposits and money market funds. Cash equivalents are primarily highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are recorded at cost,
which approximates fair value. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies which are subject to currency rate risk. Marketable Securities The Company accounts for marketable securities in accordance with SFAS
No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company determined the appropriate classification of all marketable securities was available-for-sale at the time of purchase. As such, at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, all of the Companys investments in marketable securities were reported at fair value. Fair value is determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of 
 90 
Table of ContentsNote 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  
counterparty credit worthiness, credit default risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity. Declines in fair value that are considered
other than temporary are charged to earnings and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) in stockholders equity. The Company uses the average cost method of determining
the cost basis in computing realized gains and losses on the sale of its available-for-sale securities. Realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense). Inventory Valuation Inventories are generally stated at average cost, not in excess of market.
Capital Assets and Depreciation Expenditures for additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of the major
classes of depreciable assets are 50 years for buildings and 3 to 40 years for machinery, equipment and fixtures. The Company periodically evaluates whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets
may not be recoverable. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to
exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the
loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the assets fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not
available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The Company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net
realizable value. Capitalized Software Certain costs to obtain internal use software for significant systems projects are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which ranges from 3 to 10 years. Costs to obtain software for projects that are not
significant are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software, net of accumulated amortization, included in other intangible assets, was $248 million and $291 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Amortization expense was $116
million, $124 million and $116 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Investments The Company accounts for 50% or less-owned companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence using the equity method of
accounting, otherwise the cost method is used. The Companys share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in equity in net income of affiliates in the consolidated statement of earnings. Losses are recognized in other income
(expense) when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary. The Company reviews its equity investments for impairment based on its determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the Companys
carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock and related interpretations,
which set forth factors to be evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized, including the Companys ability to hold its investment, the market price and market price fluctuations of the investments publicly traded
shares and inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity, which would justify the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment
annually using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting units
goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment in the first quarter of 2007 and monitored for any potential impairment in the remaining quarters of 2007, neither of which indicated an
impairment of goodwill. Other intangible assets, consisting of
patents, trademarks, technology, licenses, and capitalized software, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, ranging from 3 to 17 years. Such intangible assets, other than capitalized software, are deemed to be impaired if
their net carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value. Capitalized software is evaluated for impairment as described under Impairment of Long-Lived Assets above.  91 
Table of ContentsNote 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  Restructuring To streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities, the Company has periodically recorded restructuring charges. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans,
including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Product Liability Accruals for product liability (including associated legal costs) are recorded on an undiscounted basis
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress or as additional information
becomes available. Receivables for related insurance or other third-party recoveries for product liabilities are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be realized and are classified as a reduction of litigation
charges in the consolidated statement of earnings. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government
investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, and tax matters. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the Company records accruals for such loss contingencies when it is probable that a
liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company, in accordance with SFAS No. 5, does not recognize gain contingencies until realized. For a discussion of contingencies, see Note 8. Income
Taxes and Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company principally in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures. The Company
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The Company records all derivative instruments on the
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in a derivatives fair value are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI
and are subsequently recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; cash flows are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. For purchased foreign currency options, the entire change in fair
value is included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness for cash flow hedges. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges, if any, are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. The Company designates and assigns derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities. When hedged assets or
liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged are no longer expected to occur, the Company immediately recognizes the gain or loss on the designated hedging financial instruments in the consolidated statement of
earnings. Shipping and Handling Costs The Company typically does not charge customers for shipping and handling costs. Therefore, shipping and handling costs are included in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and were $262 million in 2007, $251 million in 2006 and
$230 million in 2005. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $505 million, $474 million and $500 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  92 
Table of ContentsNote 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company from time to time will enter into strategic alliances with third parties, which give the Company rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell
pharmaceutical products, the rights to which are owned by such third parties. As a result of these alliances, the Company may be obligated to make payments to alliance partners in connection with research and development contingent upon the
achievement of certain pre-determined criteria. For milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product, such payments are expensed as research and development. Milestone payments made in connection with regulatory approvals, including
non-U.S. regulatory approvals and additional indications, are capitalized and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the asset. All capitalized milestone payments are tested for recoverability periodically or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company records research and development, net of reimbursements, in connection with collaboration agreements. Acquired In-Process Research and Development The
fair value of in-process research and development acquired in a business combination is determined based on the present value of each research projects projected cash flows. An income approach is utilized that is consistent with guidance in
the practice aid issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Assets Acquired in Business Combinations to Be Used in Research and Development Activities: A Focus on Software, Electronic Devices and Pharmaceutical
Industries. Future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project, consistent with historical pricing, margins and expense levels of similar products. Revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth
factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles and the life of each research projects underlying patent. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected revenues are first adjusted for technical risk of
completion. The resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating the Companys weighted-average cost of capital. Other acquired in-process research and development is expensed as incurred when the underlying product has not
received regulatory approval and does not have any future alternative use. In addition, costs that are nonrefundable, related to the acquisition or licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval to be marketed and that have no
alternative future use, are charged to earnings as incurred. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share are computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share
are computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year plus the incremental shares outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options, restricted stock and convertible instruments. Foreign Currency Translation The statements of
earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S.
dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in accumulated OCI. Recently Issued Accounting Standards At its December
2007 meeting, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF in issue No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property. The EITF concluded that a
collaborative arrangement is one in which the participants are actively involved and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the ultimate commercial success of the endeavor. Revenues and costs incurred with third parties in
connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in EITF 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and other accounting literature. Payments to or from collaborators
would be evaluated and presented based on the nature of the arrangement and its terms, the nature of the entitys business, and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature. The nature and purpose of collaborative
arrangements are to be disclosed along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements. Activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should
be accounted for under other accounting literature; however required disclosure under EITF 07-1 applies to the entire collaborative agreement. This Issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and is to be applied
retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business
Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured
at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions. This Statement also requires the 
 93 
Table of ContentsNote 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  
acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the non-controlling interest in the
acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values. SFAS No. 141(R) makes various other amendments to authoritative literature intended to provide additional guidance or to confirm the guidance in that literature to that provided in this
Statement. This Statement applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement. In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB
No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated
statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. This statement also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and
presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. Changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary must be accounted for consistently, and when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair value. The gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling equity
investment. The Statement also requires entities to provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This Statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement. In June 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities. Nonrefundable advance payments
for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed,
or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided. This Issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, and earlier application is not permitted. The pronouncement is not expected to have a material
effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. The objective of SFAS
No. 159 is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes, without having to apply complex hedge accounting
provisions. Under SFAS No. 159, entities that elect the fair value option (by instrument) will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option election is irrevocable, unless a new
election date occurs. SFAS No. 159 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entitys election on its earnings, but does not eliminate disclosure requirements of
other accounting standards. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value must be displayed on the face of the balance sheet. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company did not elect
early adoption of this pronouncement as permitted. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This pronouncement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as
an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. This pronouncement also requires an employer to
measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. The pronouncement does not require prior periods to be restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 158. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 158 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and the adoption of this accounting pronouncement resulted in a $1,064 million reduction of accumulated OCI in stockholders equity, a $767 million reduction in total
assets and a $297 million increase in total liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not impact the Companys results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This pronouncement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. On November 14, 2007, the FASB agreed to a one-year deferral for the implementation of SFAS No. 157 for other non-financial assets and
liabilities. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements for financial assets and liabilities and any other assets and liabilities carried at fair
value. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement for other non-financial assets or liabilities.  94 
Table of ContentsNote 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued SAB No. 108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying the Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, that expresses the staffs views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. This
bulletin is effective for any interim period of the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a dual approach to assess the quantitative effects of financial statement
misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focus and balance sheet focus assessment. The adoption of this bulletin did not have any effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109, which, in the case of the Company, is effective as of January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 requires that all tax positions be evaluated using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements are recorded as adjustments to income taxes payable or receivable, or adjustments to
deferred taxes, or both. FIN No. 48 also requires expanded disclosure at the end of each reporting period including a tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result
of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement, the Company recognized $27 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings. In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN
No. 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48, which is effective retroactively to January 1, 2007. FSP FIN No. 48-1 provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled
for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The adoption of FSP FIN No. 48-1 did not have any effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.
This pronouncement relates to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement
did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. This pronouncement primarily resolves certain issues addressed in the implementation of SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, concerning beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The Statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the
beginning of the 2007 fiscal year. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Correctionsa replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. This pronouncement applies to all voluntary
changes in accounting principle, and revises the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change
in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. This pronouncement also requires that a change in the method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting
estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Statement does not change the transition
provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements, including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of SFAS No. 154. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Companys
consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligationsan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. FIN No. 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
Asset retirement obligations covered by FIN No. 47 are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, even if the timing and method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may
or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This Interpretation was effective no later than
the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, and adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the
Companys consolidated financial statements. In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and
directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes the Companys previous accounting under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, for periods beginning January 1, 2006. In March 2005, the
SEC issued SAB No. 107, Share-Based 
 95 
Table of ContentsNote 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  
Payment, relating to SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The
Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, and has elected the alternative method as provided in FSP No. 123(R)-3,
Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards, in determining the Companys pool of excess tax benefits. The Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Companys consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not
include, the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $112 million ($73 million, net of tax) or $0.04 per share, with a corresponding amount
recorded in additional paid-in capital within stockholders equity. Additionally, $10 million related to performance awards was reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
Note 2 ALLIANCES AND INVESTMENTS Sanofi-Aventis
The Company has agreements with Sanofi-Aventis (Sanofi) for the codevelopment and cocommercialization of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (irbesartan),
an angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, and PLAVIX* (clopidogrel), a platelet aggregation inhibitor. The worldwide alliance operates under the framework of two geographic
territories; one in the Americas (principally the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and Latin American countries) and Australia and the other in Europe and Asia. Accordingly, two territory partnerships were formed to manage central expenses, such as
marketing, research and development and royalties, and to supply finished product to the individual countries. In general, at the country level, agreements either to copromote (whereby a partnership was formed between the parties to sell each brand)
or to comarket (whereby the parties operate and sell their brands independently of each other) are in place. The agreements expire on the later of (i) with respect to PLAVIX*, 2013 and, with respect to AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, 2012 in the Americas and
Australia and 2013 in Europe and Asia and (ii) the expiration of all patents and other exclusivity rights in the applicable territory. The Company acts as the operating partner for the territory covering the Americas and Australia and owns a
50.1% majority controlling interest in this territory. Sanofis ownership interest in this territory is 49.9%. As such, the Company consolidates all country partnership results for this territory and records Sanofis share of the results
as a minority interest, net of taxes, which was $746 million in 2007, $428 million in 2006 and $578 million in 2005. The Company recorded sales in this territory and in comarketing countries in the territory covering Europe and Asia of $5,958
million in 2007, $4,355 million in 2006 and $4,805 million in 2005. Cash flows from operating activities of the partnerships in the
territory covering the Americas and Australia are recorded as operating activities within the Companys consolidated statement of cash flows. Distributions of partnership profits to Sanofi and Sanofis funding of ongoing partnership
operations occur on a routine basis and are also recorded within operating activities on the Companys consolidated statement of cash flows. Sanofi acts as the operating partner of the territory covering Europe and Asia and owns a 50.1% majority financial controlling interest within this territory. The Companys ownership interest in the partnerships within this territory
is 49.9%. The Company accounts for the investment in partnership entities in this territory under the equity method and records its share of the results in equity in net income of affiliates in the consolidated statement of earnings. The
Companys share of net income from these partnership entities before taxes was $526 million in 2007, $439 million in 2006 and $345 million in 2005. The Company routinely receives distributions of profits and provides funding for the ongoing operations of the partnerships in the territory covering Europe and Asia. These transactions are recorded as operating
activities within the Companys consolidated statement of cash flows. In 2001, the Company and Sanofi (the Companies) formed an
alliance for the copromotion of irbesartan, as part of which the Company contributed the irbesartan distribution rights in the U.S. and Sanofi paid the Company a total of $350 million in the two years ended December 31, 2002. The Company
accounted for this transaction as a sale of an interest in a license. The $350 million was deferred and is being amortized to other income over the expected useful life of the license, which is approximately 11 years from the formation of the
irbesartan copromotion alliance. The Company recognized other income of $32 million, $31 million and $31 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The unamortized portion of the deferred income is recorded in the liabilities section of the
consolidated balance sheet and was $154 million and $186 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  96

Otsuka The Company has a worldwide commercialization agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka), to codevelop and copromote with Otsuka ABILIFY* (aripiprazole) for the treatment of schizophrenia and related
psychiatric disorders, except in Japan, China, Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan and Egypt. The product is currently copromoted with Otsuka in the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France and Spain. In the
U.S., Germany and Spain, where the product is invoiced to third-party customers by the Company on behalf of Otsuka, the Company records alliance revenue for its 65% contractual share of third-party net sales and records all expenses related to the
product. The Company recognizes this alliance revenue when ABILIFY* is shipped and all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to third-party customers. In the UK, France and Italy, where the Company is presently the exclusive distributor
for the product, the Company records 100% of the net sales and related cost of products sold and expenses. The Company also has an exclusive right to sell ABILIFY* in other countries in Europe, the Americas and a number of countries in Asia. In
these countries, the Company records 100% of the net sales and related cost of products sold. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company purchases the product from Otsuka and performs finish manufacturing for sale by the Company or Otsuka to third-party customers. The agreement expires in November 2012 in the U.S. For the entire European Union, the agreement expires in June
2014. In each other country where the Company has the exclusive right to sell ABILIFY*, the agreement expires on the later of the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale in such country or expiration of the applicable patent in such country.
The Company recorded total revenue for ABILIFY* of $1,660 million in 2007, $1,282 million in 2006 and $912 million in 2005. Total
milestone payments made to Otsuka under the agreement through December 2007 were $217 million, of which $157 million was expensed as acquired in-process research and development in 1999. The remaining $60 million was capitalized in other intangible
assets and is amortized in cost of products sold over the remaining life of the agreement in the U.S., ranging from 8 to 11 years. The Company amortized in cost of products sold $6 million in each of 2007, 2006 and 2005. The unamortized capitalized
payment balance was $29 million and $35 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. ImClone The Company has a commercialization agreement expiring in September 2018 with ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone), a biopharmaceutical company focused
on developing targeted cancer treatments, for the codevelopment and copromotion of ERBITUX* in the U.S. In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Biologics License Application for ERBITUX* for use in combination with
irinotecan in the treatment of patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with
EGFR-expressing mCRC who are intolerant to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. In March 2006, the FDA approved ERBITUX* for use in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with radiation or as monotherapy. The Company
paid $250 million as a milestone payment to ImClone for each of the FDA approvals in 2004 and 2006. Under the agreement, ImClone receives a distribution fee based on a flat rate of 39% of net sales in North America. In October 2007, the Company and
ImClone amended their codevelopment agreement with Merck KGaA to provide for cocommercialization of ERBITUX* in Japan, which expires in 2032. ImClone has the ability to terminate the agreement after 2018 if they determine that it is commercially
unreasonable for them to continue. ERBITUX* is not yet marketed in Japan, although an application has been submitted with the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for the use of ERBITUX* in treating patients with advanced colorectal
cancer. The Company accounts for the $500 million total approval milestones paid in 2004 and 2006 as license acquisitions, and amortizes
the payments into the cost of products sold over the remaining term of the agreement, which ends in 2018. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company amortized into cost of products sold $38 million, $34 million and $17 million, respectively. The
unamortized portion of the approval payments is recorded in other intangible assets, and was $397 million and $435 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  97 
Table of ContentsNote 2 ALLIANCES AND INVESTMENTS (Continued)  The Company accounts for its investment in ImClone under the equity method and records its share of
the results in equity in net income of affiliates in the consolidated statement of earnings. The Companys recorded investment and the market value of its holdings in ImClone common stock was $114 million and approximately $619 million as of
December 31, 2007, respectively, and $109 million and approximately $385 million as of December 31, 2006, respectively. The Company holds 14.4 million shares of ImClone stock, representing approximately 17% of ImClones shares
outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006. On a per share basis, the carrying value of the ImClone investment and the closing market price of the ImClone shares as of December 31, 2007 were $7.92 and $43.00, respectively, compared to $7.59
and $26.76, respectively, as of December 31, 2006. The Company determines its equity share in ImClones net income or loss by
eliminating from ImClones results the milestone revenue ImClone recognizes for the $400 million in pre-approval milestone payments made by the Company from 2001 through 2003. The Company recorded $80 million of the pre-approval milestone
payments as an equity investment and expensed the remaining $320 million as acquired in-process research and development during that period. Milestone revenue recognized by ImClone in excess of $400 million is not eliminated by the Company in
determining its equity share in ImClones results. For its share of ImClones results of operations, the Company recorded net income of $7 million in 2007, net income of $43 million in 2006 and a net loss of $5 million in 2005. The Company
recorded net sales for ERBITUX* of $692 million in 2007, $652 million in 2006 and $413 million in 2005. Gilead In 2004, the Company and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) entered into a joint venture to develop and commercialize a fixed-dose combination of the
Companys SUSTIVA (efavirenz) and Gileads TRUVADA* (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in the U.S. In July 2006, the FDA granted approval of ATRIPLA* (efavirenz 600 mg/ emtricitabine 200 mg/ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300
mg) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection in adults. In September 2006, the companies amended their agreements to commercialize ATRIPLA* in Canada. ATRIPLA* was approved by Health Canada in October 2007 and by the European
Commission in December 2007 for commercialization in the 27 countries of the EU, as well as Norway and Iceland. Gilead records 100% of
ATRIPLA* revenues and consolidates the results of the joint venture in its operating results. The Company records revenue for the bulk efavirenz component of ATRIPLA* upon sales of that product by the joint venture with Gilead to third-party
customers. The Companys revenue for the efavirenz component is determined by applying a percentage to ATRIPLA* revenue, which approximates revenue for the SUSTIVA brand. The Company recorded efavirenz revenues of $335 million in 2007 and
$76 million in 2006, respectively, related to ATRIPLA* sales. The Company accounts for its participation in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting and records its share of the joint venture results in equity in net income of
affiliates in the consolidated statement of earnings. The Company recorded an equity loss on the joint venture with Gilead of $9 million in 2007, $6 million in 2006 and $4 million in 2005. AstraZeneca In January 2007, the Company entered
into two worldwide (except for Japan) codevelopment and cocommercialization agreements with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca), one for the codevelopment and cocommercialization of saxagliptin, a DPP-IV inhibitor (Saxagliptin Agreement), and one for the
codevelopment and cocommercialization of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose contransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (SGLT2 Agreement). Both compounds are being studied for the treatment of diabetes and were discovered by the Company. Under the terms of the
agreements, the Company received from AstraZeneca an upfront payment of $100 million in January 2007, which was deferred and is being recognized over the useful life of the products into other income. The Company amortized into other income $7
million of upfront payments in 2007. The unamortized portion of the upfront payment was $93 million as of December 31, 2007. Milestone payments are expected to be received by the Company upon the successful achievement of various development
and regulatory events as well as sales-related milestones. Under the Saxagliptin Agreement, the Company could receive up to $300 million if all development and regulatory milestones are met and up to an additional $300 million if all sales-based
milestones are met. Under the SGLT2 Agreement, the Company could receive up to $350 million if all development and regulatory milestones are met and up to an additional $300 million if all sales-based milestones are met. Under each agreement, the
Company and AstraZeneca also share in development and commercialization costs. The majority of development costs under the initial development plans through 2009 will be paid by AstraZeneca and any additional development costs will generally be
shared equally. The Company records development costs related to saxagliptin and dapagliflozin net of AstraZenecas share in research and development expenses. Under each agreement, the two companies will jointly develop the clinical and
marketing strategy and share commercialization expenses and profits/losses equally on a global basis, excluding Japan, and the Company will manufacture both products. Pfizer         In April 2007, the Company and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) entered into a worldwide codevelopment and cocommercialization agreement for apixaban, an anticoagulant discovered by
the Company being studied for the prevention and treatment of a broad range of venous and arterial thrombotic conditions. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, Pfizer made an upfront payment of $250 
 98 
Table of ContentsNote 2 ALLIANCES AND INVESTMENTS (Continued)  
million to the Company in May 2007, which was deferred and is being recognized over the life of the agreement into other income. In December 2007, the
Company and Pfizer agreed to include Japan in the worldwide agreement. In connection with the Japan agreement, Pfizer made an additional upfront payment of $40 million in December 2007 which was deferred and is being recognized over the useful life
of the product into other income. The Company amortized into other income $11 million of the two upfront payments in 2007. The unamortized portion of the upfront payment is $279 million as of December 31, 2007. Pfizer will fund 60% of all
development costs effective January 1, 2007 going forward, and the Company will fund 40%. The Company records apixaban development costs net of Pfizers share in research and development expenses. The Company may also receive additional
payments of up to $780 million from Pfizer based on development and regulatory milestones. The companies will jointly develop the clinical and marketing strategy, will share commercialization expenses and profits/losses equally on a global basis and
will manufacture product under this arrangement. Note 3 RESTRUCTURING 2007 Activities In December 2007, the Company announced a three-year plan to fundamentally change
the way it runs its business to meet the challenges of a changing business environment and to take advantage of the diverse opportunities in the marketplace as the Company is transformed into a next-generation biopharmaceutical company. With its
previously announced PTI, the Company aims to achieve a culture of continuous improvement that will enhance its efficiency, effectiveness and competitiveness and substantially improve its cost base. During 2007, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $189 million, relating to the termination benefits and other related costs for workforce reductions
of approximately 2,800 manufacturing, selling and administrative personnel across all geographic regions. These charges were offset by $6 million of adjustments reflecting changes in estimates for restructuring actions taken in prior periods.
The following table presents detail of the charges by segment and type. The Company expects to substantially complete these activities by
the end of 2008.

2006 Activities During 2006, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $73 million, relating to the termination benefits and other related costs for workforce reductions of approximately 1,080 selling, operating and administrative
personnel primarily in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. These charges were decreased by $14 million of adjustments reflecting changes in estimates for restructuring actions taken in prior periods. The following table presents detail of the charges by segment and type. The Company expects to substantially complete these activities during 2008.

Table of ContentsNote 3 RESTRUCTURING (Continued)  2005 Activities During 2005, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $33 million, relating to the termination benefits and other related costs for workforce reductions of approximately 640 selling and administrative personnel
primarily in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia. This charge includes the restructuring of the U.S. cardiovascular/metabolics primary care sales organization. These charges were offset by $1 million of adjustments reflecting
changes in estimates for restructuring actions taken in prior periods. The following table presents detail of the charges by segment and
type. The Company substantially completed these restructuring activities in 2006.

In addition to these charges, the Company recorded $110 million, $186 million and $110 million of
accelerated depreciation and fixed asset impairment charges primarily related to the rationalization of its manufacturing network in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These charges were primarily recorded in cost of products sold on the
consolidated statement of operations and primarily related to the Pharmaceuticals segment. Note 4 ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES In October 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc. (Adnexus), developer of a new therapeutic class of biologics called
ADNECTINS, for a net purchase price of $415 million. In addition, in the event that certain future development and regulatory milestones are achieved, the Company is obligated under the terms of the agreement to pay the former stockholders of
Adnexus up to an additional $74 million. The net purchase price for the acquisition was preliminarily allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition
date. Of the $415 million, $230 million was allocated to acquired in-process research and development, which was immediately expensed, and $27 million was assigned to identifiable intangible assets, predominantly related to existing process
technology to be used in future discovery. The excess of the purchase price and associated transaction costs over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. This acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method,
and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma supplemental financial information for 2007 is not included as the impact of the business
combination is not material. In July 2007, the Company completed the sale of the BUFFERIN* and EXCEDRIN* brands in Japan, Asia (excluding
China and Taiwan) and certain Oceanic countries to Lion Corporation (Japan) for $247 million in cash. As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $247 million ($144 million net of tax) in the third quarter of 2007.
In January 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
inventory, trademark, patent and intellectual property rights in the U.S. related to DOVONEX*, a treatment for psoriasis, to Warner Chilcott Company, Inc. for $200 million in cash. In addition, the Company received a royalty based on 5% of net sales
of DOVONEX* through the end of 2007. As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $200 million ($130 million net of tax) in the first quarter of 2006.  100 
Table of ContentsNote 4 ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (Continued)  In the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. and Canadian Consumer
Medicines (Consumer Medicines) business and related assets to Novartis AG (Novartis). Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis acquired the trademarks, patents and intellectual property rights of Consumer Medicines for $661 million in cash,
including the impact of a working capital adjustment, of which $15 million is attributable to a post-closing supply arrangement between the Company and Novartis. The related assets include the rights to the U.S. Consumer Medicines brands in Latin
America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The results of operations of Consumer Medicines are included in the Companys consolidated statement of earnings up to the date of disposal. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a
pre-tax gain of $569 million ($370 million net of tax) in the third quarter of 2005. Note 5 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
In December 2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Avista Capital Partners L.P. (Avista) for the sale of its
Medical Imaging business, for a purchase price of approximately $525 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The closing of the transaction was completed on January 7, 2008. The Company expects to recognize a pre-tax
gain of approximately $20 million to $40 million ($30 million to $50 million loss net of tax) in the first quarter of 2008, subject to the post-closing adjustments. The results of the Medical Imaging business, which previously were included in the
former Other Health Care operating segment, are included in income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, for all periods presented. The net assets associated with the Medical Imaging business, totaling approximately $483 million, as well
as other assets totaling $42 million, have been reclassified to assets held for sale as of December 31, 2007. For a period of time,
the Company will continue to generate cash flows and to report income statement activity in income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, associated with the Medical Imaging business. The activities that give rise to these cash flows and
income statement activities are transitional in nature and generally result from agreements that ensure and facilitate the orderly transfer of business operations. The agreements include services for accounting, customer service, distribution and
manufacturing. These activities are not expected to be material to the Companys results of operations or cash flows. These agreements extend for periods generally less than 24 months, with the majority ranging between 3 to 6 months.
The following assets and liabilities have been segregated and classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held
for sale, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. These assets and liabilities relate to the Medical Imaging business described above, totaling $483 million, as well as other assets totaling $42 million. The
balances as of December 31, 2006 were not reclassified. The amounts presented below were adjusted to exclude cash and intercompany receivables and payables between the business held for sale and the Company, which were excluded from the
divestiture. In addition, goodwill at December 31, 2007 of $2 million has been excluded from the following summary of net assets held for sale, which will be considered in determining the gain on sale in 2008.

Partners LLC for cash proceeds of $197 million, including the impact of a preliminary working capital adjustment. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $63 million ($13 million net of tax), that was presented as a gain on sale of discontinued
operations in the consolidated statement of earnings. OTN was previously presented as a separate segment.  101 
Table of ContentsNote 5 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE (Continued)  The following summarized financial information related to the Medical Imaging and OTN businesses have
been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations through the date of disposition and do not reflect the costs of certain services provided to Medical Imaging and OTN by the Company. Such costs, which were not
allocated by the Company to Medical Imaging and OTN, were for services, which included legal counsel, insurance, external audit fees, payroll processing, certain human resource services and information technology systems support.

Table of ContentsNote 6 EARNINGS PER SHARE The numerator for basic earnings per share is net earnings available to common stockholders. The numerator for diluted earnings per share is net earnings available to common stockholders with interest expense added
back for the assumed conversion of the convertible debt into common stock. The denominator for basic earnings per share is the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period. The denominator for diluted earnings per share is
weighted-average shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options and assumed conversion of the convertible debt into common stock. The computations for basic and diluted earnings per common share were as follows:

The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and
income taxes was 22.7% in 2007 compared with 22.4% in 2006 and 20.2% in 2005. The 2007 tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the impairment on the Companys investment in certain auction rate securities (ARS) with no tax benefit and the
non-deductible write-off of acquired in-process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of Adnexus, partially offset by a tax benefit of $105 million in the first quarter of 2007 due to the favorable resolution of certain tax
matters with the U.S. Internal Revenues Service (IRS) related to the deductibility of litigation settlement expenses and the impact of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for 2006 was unfavorably impacted by the elimination of tax benefits
under Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, the treatment of provisions for a portion of certain litigation reserves as non-deductible, partially offset by favorable U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2006 related to the tax treatment of
certain intercompany transactions amongst the Companys foreign subsidiaries, and the implementation of tax planning strategies related to the utilization of certain charitable contributions. The increase in the 2006 effective tax rate from
2005 was primarily due to the aforementioned Section 936 benefit elimination, the treatment of provisions for a portion of certain litigation reserves as non-deductible, tax benefits in 2005 associated with the settlement of an IRS examination
and a favorable adjustment in 2005 to taxes on special dividends under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, partially offset by favorable U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2006 related to the tax treatment of certain intercompany transactions
amongst the Companys foreign subsidiaries, and the implementation of tax planning strategies in 2006 related to the utilization of certain charitable contributions.

 The Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets at December 31, 2007 related to U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,140 million, U.S. research tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $275 million and charitable contribution carryforwards of $80 million. The charitable contribution carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2009, while the foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards expire in
varying amounts beginning in 2012. The foreign tax credit and research tax credit have been reduced due to derecognition under FIN No. 48. Realization of these credits and the charitable contribution carryforwards is dependent on generating
sufficient domestic taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company anticipates increasing its level of
domestic profitability over time by undertaking actions such as its PTI, increasing its biologics manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and implementing tax planning strategies. While increasing domestic profitability will likely cause the
Companys effective tax rate to increase, it will also further enhance the Companys ability to utilize its foreign tax credit, research tax credit and charitable contribution carryforwards. The Company also recorded deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1,461 million at December 31, 2007, an
increase of $1,265 million compared to $196 million at December 31, 2006, primarily due to an international reorganization of two of the Companys foreign affiliates. These operating loss carryforwards related to the international
reorganization were fully offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance of $1,261 million, reflecting the Companys view that the loss carryfowards are not expected to be realized. The valuation allowance of $1,950 million at December 31, 2007 relates to $72 million of state deferred tax assets, $1,448 million of foreign net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, $426 million of state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that the Company believes, more likely than not, will not be realized, and $4 million of state deferred tax assets related to the
Adnexus acquisition that was offset against goodwill. Income taxes paid during the year were $994 million, $741 million and $1,556 million
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In October 2007, the
Company filed a refund claim with the IRS for the years 2000 and 2001 to carry back foreign tax credits to recover taxes paid in 2000 and 2001. The principal amount of the refund claim is approximately $334 million. In the fourth quarter of 2007,
the Company accrued interest income on this refund claim for approximately $45 million, net of federal benefit, which has been reflected in provision for income taxes.  
106 
Table of ContentsNote 8 INCOME TAXES (Continued)  The current tax benefit realized upon the exercise of stock options is credited to capital in excess
of par value of stock and amounted to $5 million, $10 million and $19 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of
December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $14.1 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which taxes have not been provided as the Company has invested or expects to invest these undistributed earnings permanently
offshore. If, in the future, these earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the
assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided. The
Company conducts business in various countries throughout the world and is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company files a significant number of tax returns that are subject to examination by
various Federal, state and local tax authorities. Tax examinations are often complex, as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by the Company and may require several years to resolve. The Company establishes liabilities
for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes
ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. The effect of changes in estimates related to contingent tax liabilities is included in the effective tax rate reconciliation above. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, resulting in the recognition of $27 million of previously unrecognized
tax benefits which was accounted for as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings. A reconciliation of the Companys changes in uncertain tax positions from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007 is as follows:

The uncertain tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 are recorded against the Companys
deferred tax assets to the extent the uncertainty directly related to that asset; otherwise, they are recorded as either current or non-current income tax payable. As previously reported, upon the adoption of FIN No. 48, the Companys total amount of uncertain tax benefits as of January 1, 2007,
net of deferred income tax benefits and excluding interest and penalties, was $960 million. In addition, the Company derecognized upon adoption $180 million of unrecognized tax benefits, for which there is no tax rate impact when settled. As such,
the gross unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 were $1,140 million.  107 
Table of ContentsNote 8 INCOME TAXES (Continued)  Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was $242 million of uncertain tax positions as
of January 1, 2007 and $264 million as of December 31, 2007, for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax
accounting, other than interest and penalties, if applicable, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority or utilization of tax
attributes to an earlier period. The amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were
$898 million as of January 1, 2007, and $794 million as of December 31, 2007. The Company classifies interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. These amounts are reflected separately on the reconciliation above. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the statement of earnings
for 2007 was $59 million for interest and $5 million for penalties. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 was $81 million for interest and $27
million for penalties. The Company is currently under examination by a number of tax authorities, including all of the major tax
jurisdictions listed in the table below, which have proposed adjustments to tax for issues such as transfer pricing, certain tax credits and the deductibility of certain expenses. The Company estimates that it is reasonably possible that the balance
of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 will decrease in the range of approximately $175 million to $215 million in the next twelve months as a result of the anticipated effective settlement of certain tax audits for the
jurisdictions listed below. Such settlements will involve the payment of additional taxes, the adjustment of certain deferred taxes and/or the recognition of tax benefits. The Company also anticipates that it is reasonably possible that new issues
will be raised by tax authorities who may require increases to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits; however, an estimate of such increases cannot be made. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for all open tax years by tax
jurisdiction under FIN No. 48. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities. The following is a summary of major tax jurisdictions for which tax authorities may assert
additional taxes against the Company based upon tax years currently under audit and subsequent years that will likely be audited:

Table of ContentsNote 9 CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 and 2006 primarily consisted of bank deposits, time deposits and money market funds. Cash equivalents are
primarily highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances in U.S. dollars and foreign
currencies which are subject to currency rate risk. Marketable securities at December 31, 2007 consisted of U.S. dollar-denominated
floating rate securities (FRS), which are primarily AAA/Aaa rated. FRS are long-term debt securities with coupons that are reset periodically against a benchmark interest rate. The underlying assets of the Companys FRS consist of
primarily investment grade corporate bonds and loans. The Company accounts for its marketable securities in accordance with SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and classifies them as available for
sale. The carrying value of FRS was reduced by $25 million, from $362 million to $337 million at December 31, 2007, reflecting the change in fair market value. The Company assessed this decline in fair market value to be temporary, and
recorded a pre-tax $25 million reduction ($16 million net of tax) in shareholders equity in accumulated OCI. In addition, at
December 31, 2007, the Company had $811 million of principal invested in ARS. The ARS held by the Company are private placement securities with long-term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a dutch auction each
month. The monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities. The Companys investments in ARS represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of residential and commercial mortgages or
credit cards, insurance securitizations and other structured credits, including corporate bonds. Some of the underlying collateral for the ARS held by the Company consists of sub-prime mortgages. Consistent with the Companys investment policy guidelines, the ARS investments held by the Company all had AAA/Aaa credit ratings at the time of
purchase. With the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the ARS held by the Company at December 31, 2007 have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the
amount of purchase orders. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2007, $79 million of principal invested in ARS held by the Company were downgraded and others were placed on credit watch. All of these securities retained at least one AAA rating as
of December 31, 2007. The estimated market value of the Companys ARS holdings at December 31, 2007 was $419 million, which
reflects a $392 million adjustment to the principal value of $811 million. Although the ARS continue to pay interest according to their stated terms, based on valuation models and an analysis of other-than-temporary impairment factors, the Company
has recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $275 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the portion of ARS holdings that the Company has concluded have an other-than-temporary decline in value. In addition, the Company recorded an
unrealized loss of $117 million (pre-tax and net of tax) in accumulated OCI as a reduction in shareholders equity, reflecting adjustments to ARS holdings that the Company has concluded have a temporary decline in value. The $275 million
impairment charge does not have a material impact on the Companys liquidity or financial flexibility. ARS were classified in prior
periods as current assets under marketable securities. Given the failed auctions, the Companys ARS are illiquid until there is a successful auction for them. Accordingly, the entire amount of such remaining ARS has been reclassified from
marketable securities to non-current other assets. Marketable securities at December 31, 2006 consisted of U.S. dollar-denominated

Note 15 SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT Short-term borrowings at the end of 2007 and 2006 were $1.9 billion and $187 million, respectively. Long-term debt was $4.4 billion at December 31,
2007 compared to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2006. In 2007, the Company reclassified from long-term debt to short-term borrowings
the $108 million of 1.10% Yen Notes, due 2008; the $31 million of 1.43% Yen Notes, due 2008; the $400 million of 4.00% Notes, due 2008, and associated unamortized discount and interest rate swap valuation; and the $1.2 billion of Floating Rate
Convertible Debentures, due 2023 (with a 2008 put/call). In September 2007, the Company repaid the $1.3 billion remaining balance of the
five-year tranche of its Floating Rate Bank Term Facility, due 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company restructured its
long-term debt by retiring all of its outstanding $2.5 billion, 5.75% Notes due 2011, through a cash tender offer and subsequent redemption and issuing 500 million ($641 million at inception) aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Notes due
2016 and 500 million ($641 million at inception) aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Notes due 2021, as well as $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Notes due 2036, which resulted in a $220 million pre-tax expense, which
are comprised of the items discussed below. The premium paid on the debt tender and make whole was $72 million and $24 million, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized in earnings $12 million of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs
associated with the 2011 debt, incurred a pre-tax loss of $62 million related to the termination of the remaining $2.0 billion notional amount of its 2011 fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements and recognized in earnings the pre-tax
unamortized portion of $18 million from the aforementioned loss incurred on the termination of $500 million notional amount on the 2011 fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that occurred in June 2005. Furthermore, in November 2006 the Company
recognized in earnings from accumulated OCI the pre-tax unamortized portion of $32 million ($21 million net of tax) from the loss incurred on the 2011 settlement of its interest rate lock contracts, which were used to manage its exposure to changes
in interest rates for the anticipated issuance of the 2011 long-term fixed rate debt. In December 2006, the Company replaced its prior $2
billion revolving credit facility with a new $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders, which is extendable on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. This facility contains customary terms and
conditions substantially similar to the prior facility, including a financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each quarter. The Company has been in compliance with this covenant
since the inception of this new facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2007. The Company has unused short-term lines of credit and available trade finance facilities with foreign banks
of $109 million and $402 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  112

 The Companys outstanding $1.2 billion of convertible debentures pay interest quarterly at an annual
rate equal to three-month LIBOR, reset quarterly, minus 0.50% (the yield never to be less than zero) and have a final maturity of September 15, 2023. The debentures are callable at par at any time on or after September 21, 2008 by the
issuer. Holders can also redeem some or all of their debentures at par on September 15, 2008, 2013 and 2018, or if a fundamental change in ownership of the Company occurs. The bond has an initial conversion price of $41.28, or a conversion rate
of 24.2248 shares, which will be adjustable depending on the average closing prices for the applicable period. The maximum conversion rate is 38.7597 shares. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps for $4.1 billion (U.S. dollar value at December 31, 2007) of its long-term debt.
In 2006, in conjunction with the new issuance of $1.25 billion 5.875% Notes due 2036 and 1.0 billion Notes ($1.3 billion at inception), the Company executed several fixed to floating interest rate swaps to convert the new fixed rate debt to be
paid in 2016, 2021 and 2036 to variable rate debt. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company realized net increases in interest expense of $13 million and $18 million, respectively, as a result of the higher floating rates
obtained in the swap agreements. In November 2006, in connection with the early retirement of its outstanding $2.5 billion 5.75% Notes due
2011, the Company terminated the remaining $2.0 billion notional amount of its 2011 fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements and incurred a pre-tax loss of $62 million. In April 2005, in connection with the early redemption of its $2.5
billion Notes due 2006, the Company terminated $2 billion notional amount of its 2006 fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements and incurred a pre-tax loss of $28 million. In June 2005, the Company terminated $500 million notional amount of
its 2011 fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements related to its $2.5 billion Notes due 2011 and incurred a pre-tax loss of $23 million. This loss was amortized to interest expense, with $3 million and $2 million recognized in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The remaining loss of $18 million, together with the $62 million loss incurred from the unwind of $2.0 billion swap was fully recognized in 2006. In September 2005, the Company terminated $350 million notional amount of its 2026
fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements related to its $350 million Debentures due 2026 at a pre-tax gain of $39 million. This gain will be recognized against interest expense over the remaining life of the Debentures due 2026, of which
approximately $1 million, pre-tax, was recognized in 2007 and 2006. Cash payments for interest, including payments due to interest rate
swaps, were $610 million, $682 million and $598 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys cash receipts from interest rate swaps were $210 million, $205 million and $275 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and were
excluded from cash payments for interest.

 2008 obligations are included in short-term borrowings on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2007 and all balances approximate the outstanding nominal long-term debt values. The Companys convertible debenture is included as due for payment in 2008, as it contains a 2008 put and call feature as described above.

Table of ContentsNote 15 SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT (Continued)  At December 31, 2007, the Company had provided a total of $236 million financial guarantees in
the form of stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds. The stand-by letters of credit are with insurance companies in support of third-party liability programs. The performance bonds have been issued to support a range of ongoing operating
activities, including sale of Company products to hospitals and foreign ministries of health, bonds for customs, duties and value added tax and guarantees related to miscellaneous legal actions. A significant majority of the Companys
outstanding financial guarantees will expire within the year and are not expected to be funded. Note 16 STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Changes in common shares, treasury stock, capital in excess of par value of stock and restricted stock were as follows:

Each share of the Companys preferred stock is convertible into 16.96 shares of common stock
and is callable at the Companys option. The reductions in the number of issued shares of preferred stock in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were due to conversions into shares of common stock. Dividends declared per common share were $1.15 in 2007, $1.12 in 2006 and $1.12 in 2005.

Table of ContentsNote 17 EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS Employee Stock Plans On May 1, 2007, the stockholders approved the Companys 2007 Stock
Award and Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan). The 2007 Plan replaced the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2002 Plan) that expired on May 31, 2007. The 2007 Plan provides for 42 million new shares of common stock reserved for delivery to
participants, plus shares remaining available for new grants under the 2002 Plan and shares recaptured from outstanding awards under the 2002 Plan. Only the number of shares actually delivered to participants in connection with an award after all
restrictions have lapsed will be counted against the number of shares reserved. Shares tendered in a prior year to pay the purchase price of options and the number of shares previously utilized to satisfy withholding tax obligations upon exercise
continue to be available and reserved. At December 31, 2007, 352 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock plans, options and conversions of preferred stock. There were 98 million and 39 million
shares available to be granted for the active plans as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, adjusted for the combination of plans. Under the Companys 2007 Plan and the 2002 Plan, executive officers and key employees may be granted options to purchase the Companys common stock at no less than 100% of the market price on the date the option is granted.
Options generally become exercisable in installments of 25% per year on each of the first through the fourth anniversaries of the grant date and have a maximum term of 10 years. Generally, the Company issues shares for the stock option exercise
from treasury stock. Additionally, the plan provides for the granting of stock appreciation rights whereby the grantee may surrender exercisable rights and receive common stock and/or cash measured by the excess of the market price of the common
stock over the option exercise price. The 2007 Plan and the 2002 Plan provide for the granting of common stock to key employees, subject
to restrictions as to continuous employment. Restrictions generally expire over a four-year period from date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the restricted period. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company began granting
restricted stock units instead of restricted stock. The 2007 Plan and the 2002 Plan also incorporate the Companys long-term
performance awards. These awards, which are delivered in the form of a target number of performance shares, have a three-year cycle. For 2007 to 2009, the awards have annual goals set at the beginning of each performance period and are
based 50% on earnings per share and 50% on sales. Maximum performance will result in a maximum payout of 220%. The goals for the 2005 through 2007 and the 2006 through 2008 awards are set for the three-year period and are based 50% on
cumulative earnings per share and 50% on cumulative sales, with the ultimate payout modified by the Companys total stockholder return versus the 11 companies in its proxy peer group. Maximum performance for all three measures will result in a
maximum payout of 253% of target. If threshold targets are not met for the performance period, no payment will be made under the plan. Under the TeamShare Stock Option Plan, which terminated on January 3, 2005, full-time employees, excluding key executives, were granted options to purchase the Companys common stock at the market price on the date the options
were granted. The Company authorized 66 million shares for issuance under the plan. Individual grants generally became exercisable evenly on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of 10 years. Options
on 35.6 million shares have been exercised under the plan as of December 31, 2007. The Companys results of operations for
the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R), which includes the impact of the expensing of stock options. The Company has elected the alternative method as provided in FSP No. 123(R)-3 in
determining the Companys pool of excess tax benefits. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 were not restated to reflect the impact of expensing of stock options and are prepared in accordance with APB
No. 25. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense, net of tax, related to employee stock options, restricted stock and long-term performance awards for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value,
based on the Companys closing stock price of $26.52 on December 31, 2007, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. The total number of in-the-money options
exercisable as of December 31, 2007 was 28 million. As of December 31, 2006, 123 million outstanding options were exercisable and the weighted-average exercise price was $42.03.  117 
Table of ContentsNote 17 EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS (Continued)  The fair value of employee stock options granted in 2007 were estimated on the date of the grant and,
prior to January 1, 2006, were estimated using a weighted-average estimated per option value granted, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

The Company derived the expected volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model by
calculating a 10-year historical volatility and weighting that equally against the derived implied volatility, consistent with SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107. Prior to 2006, the Company had used its historical stock price volatility in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 for purposes of its pro forma information. The selection of the blended historical and implied volatility approach was based on the Companys assessment that this calculation of expected volatility is more
representative of future stock price trends than using only historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon
the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Companys history and expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model. The expected life of
employee stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of the Companys model. The lattice-binomial model assumes that employees exercise behavior is a function of the options remaining vested life
and the extent to which the option is in-the-money. The lattice-binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the entire history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by
the Company. Prior to 2006, the Company used an option-pricing model to indirectly estimate the expected life of the stock options. The
expected life and expected volatility of the stock options were based upon historical and other economic data trended into the future. Forfeitures of employee stock options were accounted for on an as-incurred basis. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is based
on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. In the Companys pro forma information required under SFAS No. 123 for the periods prior to 2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.
The Company acquired Adnexus on October 19, 2007. As part of the acquisition agreement, the Company assumed 24 million shares of
Adnexus incentive stock options (ISOs) and replaced them with 0.6 million shares of Company ISOs. The converted options retain their original vesting schedules, including the vesting commencement date, as well as the expiration date. A
Black-Scholes model was used to determine the expected term and the individual ISOs valuations. The result was a weighted-average expected term of 5.2 years and a weighted-average fair value on October 19, 2007 of $20.34.  118 
Table of ContentsNote 17 EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS (Continued)  Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units The fair value of nonvested shares of the Companys common stock is determined based on the average trading price of the Companys common stock

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there was $145 million and $126 million, respectively, of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock and restricted stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years for the balance at December 31, 2007 and 2.75 years for
the balance at December 31, 2006. The total cost of non-vested shares and share units granted that was recognized as compensation expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $53 million, $34 million and $27
million, respectively. The total fair value of shares and share units that vested during the 12 months ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $35 million, $21 million and $14 million, respectively. Performance Awards Prior to the adoption of SFAS
No. 123(R), compensation expense related to performance awards was determined based on the market price of the Companys stock at the time of the award applied to the expected number of shares contingently issuable (up to 100%) and was
amortized over the three-year performance cycle. Since the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the fair value of the 2006 through 2008
performance award was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model due to a market condition. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying each market
condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the long-term performance awards. For the 2007 through 2009 performance award, because the award does not contain a market condition, the fair value was based on the
closing trading price of the Companys common stock on the grant date. The valuation model for the 2006 through 2008 award used the
following assumptions:

Weighted-average expected volatility is based on the three-year historical volatility levels on
the Companys common stock. Expected dividend yield is based on historical dividend payments. Risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on five-year zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds, based on the performance shares contractual term. The
fair value of the performance awards is amortized over the performance period of the award.  119

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, there was $11 million and $2 million, respectively, of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to the performance share plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years and 2.0 years, respectively. Accuracy of Fair Value Estimates The Companys determination of fair value of stock-based
payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Companys stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to
the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no
vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because the Companys employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can
materially affect the estimated value, in managements opinion, the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the Companys employee stock options. Although the fair value of employee stock options
is determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB 107 using an option-pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made
to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes the Companys previous accounting under APB No. 25 for periods beginning January 1, 2006. In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107
relating to SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The
Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, and has elected the alternative method as provided in FSP No. 123(R)-3
in determining the Companys pool of excess tax benefits. The Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective
transition method, the Companys consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS
No. 123(R) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $133 million and $112 million, respectively, ($88 million and $73 million, net of tax, respectively) or $0.04 per share and $0.04 per share, respectively, with a corresponding
amount recorded in additional paid-in capital within stockholders equity. Additionally, in 2006, $10 million related to performance awards was reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity in connection with the adoption of SFAS
No. 123(R).  120 
Table of ContentsNote 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce that risk, the Company enters into certain derivative financial instruments, when available on a
cost-effective basis, to hedge its underlying economic exposure. These instruments are managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take advantage of any natural offsets. Derivative financial instruments are not used for
speculative purposes. The Companys primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen,
Mexican peso and Chinese renminbi. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, primarily
intercompany transactions, on certain foreign currencies and designates these derivative instruments as foreign currency cash flow hedges when appropriate. The notional amounts of the Companys foreign exchange derivative contracts at
December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $1,656 million and $1,585 million, respectively. For these derivatives, in which the majority qualify as hedges of future anticipated cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily
deferred in accumulated OCI and then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. The table below summarizes the
Companys outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of December 31, 2007. The fair value of all foreign exchange forward contracts is based on year-end currency rates. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts should be
viewed in relation to the fair value of the underlying hedged transactions and the overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

 Non-qualifying hedges are hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as prescribed by SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. At December 31, 2007, the Company held foreign
exchange option contracts to buy and sell Japanese Yen. The total notional and fair market value for buy contracts is $145 million and $1 million, respectively, which are fully offset by the total notional and fair market value for sell contracts of
$145 million and $1 million, respectively. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company reclassified pre-tax deferred losses of $56 million,
$18 million and $130 million, respectively, from accumulated OCI to earnings, the majority of which was classified as cost of products sold. As of December 31, 2007, the balance of deferred losses on foreign exchange forward contracts included
in accumulated OCI on a pre-tax basis was $54 million ($37 million net of tax), all of which is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.  121 
Table of ContentsNote 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)  SFAS No.133 requires that the Company perform periodic assessments of hedge effectiveness. These
assessments determine whether derivatives designated as qualifying hedges continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items. Any ineffective portion of fair value can no longer be deferred in accumulated OCI and
is included in current period earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the impact of hedge ineffectiveness on earnings was not significant. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the impact of
discontinued hedges was a pre-tax loss of $12 million and a pre-tax loss of $10 million, respectively. Furthermore, the Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to offset its exposure to certain currency assets and liabilities and earnings
denominated in certain foreign currencies. These foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as other income, net, as they occur. The
notional and fair value amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2007 are described in the table above. There were no foreign exchange forward contracts of this type outstanding at December 31, 2006. In 2007, the
impact of foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as hedges was a pre-tax gain of $4 million. In 2006 and 2005, the amounts recognized in earnings related to these types of foreign exchange forward contracts that did not qualify
for hedge accounting treatment were not significant. The fair value of forward contracts was a net liability of $47 million at
December 31, 2007, of which $16 million was recorded as a non-current asset and $63 million was recorded as a current liability. The fair value of forward contracts was a net liability of $33 million at December 31, 2006, of which $18
million was recorded as a non-current asset and $51 million was recorded as a current liability. The fair value of all foreign exchange contracts is based on year-end currency rates (and the Black-Scholes model in the case of option contracts).
In addition to the foreign exchange hedge contracts noted above, the Company utilizes forward contracts to hedge foreign
currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The primary objective of these forward contracts is to protect the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign
exchange rates that might occur prior to their receipt or settlement in U.S. dollars. These foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in Euro. The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are
marked to market through other expense, net. The notional and fair value amount of purchased foreign exchange forward contracts was not material at December 31, 2007, and $24 million and a $1 million asset, respectively, at December 31,
2006. There were no notional and fair value amounts of sold foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2007, and $22 million and a $1 million liability, respectively, at December 31, 2006. The Company also uses non-U.S. dollar borrowings, primarily the €500 Million Notes due 2016 and the €500 Million Notes due 2021, to hedge the
foreign currency exposures of the Companys net investment in certain foreign affiliates. These non-U.S. dollar borrowings are designated as hedges of net investments. The effective portion of foreign exchange gains or losses on these hedges is
recorded as part of the foreign currency translation component of accumulated OCI. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, $168 million and $27 million in losses, respectively, were recorded in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated OCI.
The Company had unhedged exposures to net foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $1.9 billion and $1.6
billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily in Mexico, Japan, the UK, China, Australia and Canada. The Company
uses derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps, which are subject to fair-value hedge accounting treatment.
In November 2006, in connection with the funding of the retirement of the 2011 fixed rate debt, the Company executed several fixed to floating interest rate swaps to convert $1.3 billion and 1 billion ($1.3 billion at inception) of the
Companys newly-issued fixed rate debt to be paid in 2016, 2021 and 2036 to variable rate debt. The total notional amounts of outstanding interest rate swaps were $2.6 billion and 1 billion ($1.5 billion) as of December 31, 2007 and
$2.6 billion and 1 billion ($1.3 billion) as of December 31, 2006. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the Company recognized a net increase in interest expense of $13
million and $18 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and a net reduction in interest expense of $54 million in 2005 from the impact of interest rate swaps. The swap contracts, as well as the underlying debt being hedged, are recorded at fair value, which resulted in an increase in non-current assets of $72 million, current liabilities of $96 million and a reduction in
long-term debt of $24 million at December 31, 2007; and an increase in non-current assets of $7 million, current liabilities of $57 million and a reduction in long-term debt of $50 million at December 31, 2006. Swap contracts are generally
held to maturity and are intended to create an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt for the Company. Swap contracts that qualify as fair value hedges that are terminated prior to their maturity dates are reported as part of the
carrying value of the underlying debt and are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the debt. Swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges that are terminated are reported in accumulated OCI and amortized to earnings over the remaining
life of the debt. The following tables summarize the interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 the earnings impact from terminated interest rate swap contracts for 2007, 2006 and 2005:  122

 The underlying 2026 Notes have not been extinguished. The carrying amount of the Companys other financial instruments, which includes cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable,
approximates their fair value at December 31, 2007 and 2006. For a discussion on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, see Note 9. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities above. For long-term debt, the
difference between the fair value and carrying value is not material. Note 19 SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company is organized in three reportable segmentsPharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and ConvaTec. The Pharmaceuticals segment is comprised of the
global pharmaceutical and international consumer medicines businesses. The Nutritionals segment consists of Mead Johnson, primarily an infant formula business and childrens nutritional business. The ConvaTec segment consists of the ostomy,
wound and skin care business.         In December 2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with
Avista for the sale of its Medical Imaging business. The closing of the transaction was completed in January 2008. The results of the Medical Imaging business, which previously was included in the former Other Health Care operating segment, are
included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for all periods. The net assets associated with the Medical Imaging business, totaling approximately $483 million, as well as other assets totaling $42 million, have been reclassified to
assets held for sale as of December 31, 2007 and are included in Corporate/Other below. In May 2005, the Company completed the sale of OTN to One Equity Partners LLC. The results of OTN, which previously was presented as a separate operating
segment, are included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The results of both the Medical Imaging business and OTN are not included in the tables below. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Consumer Medicines business, which is included in the Pharmaceuticals operating
segment. For additional information on the sale of Consumer Medicines, see Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures.  123 
Table of ContentsNote 19 SEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)  The Companys products are sold principally to the wholesale and retail trade, both nationally
and internationally. Certain products are also sold to other drug manufacturers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and the medical profession. Three wholesalers accounted for approximately 19%, 16% and 12%, respectively, of the Companys
total net sales in 2007. In 2006, sales to these wholesalers accounted for approximately 19%, 16% and 11%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales. In 2005, the same three wholesalers accounted for 21%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of the
Companys total net sales. These sales were concentrated in the Pharmaceuticals segment.

Operating lease rental expense (net of sublease rental income of $17 million in 2007, $21 million
in 2006 and $15 million in 2005) was $166 million in 2007, $149 million in 2006 and $150 million in 2005. In December 2006, the Company
completed the sale and leaseback of several administrative facilities in New Jersey for $283 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain from the transaction of $154 million, of which $145 million was deferred and will reduce future lease rental costs
over the lease periods ranging from 8 to 12 years. Note 21 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and termination indemnity plans for regular
full-time employees. The principal pension plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan in the U.S. The funding policy is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to fund past service liability. Plan benefits are based
primarily on the participants years of credited service and compensation. Plan assets consist principally of equity and fixed-income securities. The Company also provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits for substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in its comprehensive medical and group life plans. The medical plan is contributory.
Contributions are adjusted periodically and vary by date of retirement and the original retiring Company. The life insurance plan is noncontributory. Plan assets consist principally of equity and fixed-income securities. Similar plans exist for
employees in certain countries outside of the U.S. The net periodic benefit cost of the Companys defined benefit pension and
postretirement benefit plans included the following components:

 The Company has recognized the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 in
2007, 2006 and 2005, and in accordance with FSP No. 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, recorded $11 million for each of 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, as a reduction in net periodic benefit costs.  126 
Table of ContentsNote 21 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (Continued)  Net actuarial loss and prior service cost/(benefit) amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic
benefit costs for 2007 were $140 million and $11 million, respectively, for pension benefits; and were $6 million and a benefit of $3 million, respectively, for other benefits. The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost that will be
amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2008 are:

 (b)
 The Company has recognized the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 in
2007, 2006 and 2005, and in accordance with FSP No. 106-2, recorded $98 million and $94 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a reduction in accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Several plans had underfunded accrued benefit obligations that exceeded their accrued benefit liabilities at December 31, 2006. Additional minimum
liabilities were established to increase the accrued benefit liabilities to the values of the underfunded accrued benefit obligations. The additional minimum liabilities totaled $232 million at December 31, 2006 prior to the adoption of SFAS
No. 158, which were for a U.S. unfunded benefit equalization plan and several international plans. These liabilities were reversed against accumulated OCI upon the adoption of SFAS No. 158.  127 
Table of ContentsNote 21 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (Continued)  The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $5,417 million and
$5,422 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Information related to the Companys pension plans at December 31
was as follows:

This is attributable primarily to an unfunded U.S. benefit equalization plan and several plans in
the international markets. The unfunded U.S. benefit equalization plan provides pension benefits for employees with compensation above IRS limits and cannot be funded in a tax-advantaged manner.

At December 31, 2007, the Companys expected long-term rate of return on U.S. pension
plan assets was 8.75%. The target asset allocation is 70% public equity (58% U.S., 12% international), 8% private equity and 22% fixed income. The 8.75% was approximated by applying expected returns of 9% on public equity, 15% on private equity and
6% on fixed income to the target allocation. The actual historical returns are also relevant. Annualized returns for periods ended December 31, 2007 were 8.2% for 10 years, 10.4% for 15 years and 10.6% for 20 years. U.S. pension plan assets represented approximately 75% of total Company pension plan assets at December 31, 2007. The 8.30% disclosed above for
total Company expected return on assets for 2007 is below the 8.75% for U.S. pension plans, due to the impact of international pension plans, which typically employ a less aggressive asset allocation. An 8.75% expected return is disclosed for Other Benefits in 2007, as the relevant assets are invested in the same manner as U.S. pension plan assets and
there are no international plan assets.  128

The Companys investment strategy emphasizes equities in order to achieve high expected
returns and, in the long run, low expense and low required cash contributions. For the U.S. pension plans, a target asset allocation of 70% public equity (58% U.S., 12% international), 8% private equity and 22% fixed income is maintained and cash
flow (i.e., cash contributions, benefit payments) is used to rebalance back to the targets as necessary. Investments are well diversified within each of the three major asset categories. About 30% of the U.S. equity is passively managed. Otherwise,
all investments are actively managed. Investment strategies for international pension plans are typically similar, although the asset
allocations are usually more conservative. BristolMyers Squibb Company common stock represents less than 1% of the plan assets at
December 31, 2007 and 2006. Assets for postretirement benefits are commingled with U.S. pension plan assets and, therefore, the
investment strategy is identical to that described above for U.S. pension plans. Contributions Although no minimum contributions were required, the Company made cash contributions to the U.S. pension plans of $238 million, $235 million and $318
million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company also plans to make a cash contribution to the U.S. pension plans in 2008. When
contributions are made to the U.S. pension plans, the Company may make tax-deductible contributions to the 401(h) account for retiree medical benefits equal to a portion of the pension normal cost. Contributions to the international pension plans were $85 million, $90 million and $105 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Contributions to
the international plans are now expected to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million in 2008.  129

Savings Plan The principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and Investment Program. The Companys contribution is based on employee contributions and the level of Company match. The Companys
contributions to the plan were $60 million in 2007, $56 million in 2006 and $51 million in 2005. Termination Indemnity Plans The Company operates in certain jurisdictions, primarily in Europe, which require the recording of statutory termination obligations. These obligations
were assessed in accordance with EITF Issue No. 88-1, Determination of Vested Benefit Obligation for a Defined Benefit Pension Plan. The total pension liability recorded for these obligations was $70 million at December 31, 2007 and
$75 million at December 31, 2006.  130 
Table of ContentsNote 22 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES Various lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations are pending involving the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In accordance with SFAS
No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the Company records accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. These matters involve antitrust,
securities, patent infringement, pricing, sales and marketing practices, environmental, health and safety matters, consumer fraud, employment matters, product liability and insurance coverage. The most significant of these matters are described
below. There can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of pending matters or that any future lawsuits, claims,
proceedings or investigations will not be material. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PLAVIX* Litigation PLAVIX* is currently the Companys largest product ranked by net sales. Net
sales of PLAVIX* were approximately $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, and U.S. net sales of PLAVIX* were $4.1
billion in 2007, $2.7 billion in 2006 and $3.2 billion in 2005. The PLAVIX* patents are subject to a number of challenges in the U.S., including the litigation with Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (Apotex) described below, and in other less significant
markets for the product. It is not possible reasonably to estimate the impact of these lawsuits on the Company. However, loss of market exclusivity of PLAVIX* and sustained generic competition would be material to the Companys sales of
PLAVIX*, results of operations and cash flows, and could be material to the Companys financial condition and liquidity. The Company and its product partner, Sanofi, (the Companies) intend to vigorously pursue enforcement of their patent rights
in PLAVIX*. PLAVIX* Litigation  United States Patent Infringement Litigation against Apotex and Related Matters As previously disclosed, the Companys U.S.
territory partnership under its alliance with Sanofi is a plaintiff in a pending patent infringement lawsuit instituted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (District court) entitled Sanofi-Synthelabo, Sanofi-Synthelabo,
Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Holding Partnership v. Apotex. The suit is based on U.S. Patent No. 4,847,265 (the 265 Patent), a composition of matter patent, which discloses and claims, among other things, the
hydrogen sulfate salt of clopidogrel, a medicine made available in the U.S. by the Companies as PLAVIX*. Plaintiffs infringement position is based on Apotexs filing of their Abbreviated New Drug Application (aNDA) with the FDA, seeking
approval to sell generic clopidogrel bisulfate prior to the expiration of the composition of matter patent in 2011. Apotex has alleged that the patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. As previously disclosed, in March 2006, the Company and Sanofi announced that they had executed a proposed settlement agreement (the March Agreement)
with Apotex to settle the pending patent infringement lawsuit. In response to concerns expressed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general, the parties modified the March Agreement (the Modified Agreement) in May 2006. In
July 2006, the Companies announced that the Modified Agreement had failed to receive required antitrust clearance from the state attorneys general. On August 8, 2006, Apotex launched a generic version of clopidogrel bisulfate. On
August 31, 2006, the District court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Apotex to halt sales of generic clopidogrel bisulfate, but not to recall product from its customers. On June 19, 2007, the District court issued an opinion and
order upholding the validity and enforceability of the 265 Patent, maintaining the main patent protection for PLAVIX* in the U.S. until November 2011. The District court also ruled that Apotexs generic clopidogrel bisulfate product
infringed the 265 Patent and permanently enjoined Apotex from engaging in any activity that infringes the 265 Patent, including marketing its generic product in the U.S. until after the patent expires. The amount of damages will be set
at a later time. Apotexs appeal of the District courts decision is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with a hearing scheduled for March 2008. The District court has stayed certain antitrust counterclaims
brought by Apotex pending the outcome of the appeal. Activities relating to the damages phase of the litigation are continuing. As also
previously disclosed, the Companys U.S. territory partnership under its alliance with Sanofi is also a plaintiff in three additional pending patent infringement lawsuits against Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Inc. and
Dr. Reddys Laboratories, LTD (Dr. Reddys), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) and Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Cobalt), all related to the 265 Patent. A trial date for the action against Dr. Reddys has not been
set. On January 14, 2008, Dr. Reddys received final approval of its aNDA. On January 24, 2008, the court entered an order that requires Dr. Reddys to give the Company 10 business days notice of its intent to launch. The
patent infringement actions against Teva and Cobalt were stayed pending resolution of the Apotex litigation, and the parties to those actions agreed to be bound by the outcome of the litigation against Apotex, although Teva and Cobalt can appeal the
outcome of the litigation. 
 131 
Table of ContentsNote 22 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)  
Consequently, on July 12, 2007, the District court entered judgments against Cobalt and Teva and permanently enjoined Cobalt and Teva from engaging in
any activity that infringes the 265 Patent until after the Patent expires. Cobalt and Teva have each filed an appeal. Each of Dr. Reddys, Teva and Cobalt have filed an aNDA with the FDA, and all exclusivity periods and statutory
stay periods under the Hatch-Waxman Act have expired. Accordingly, final approval by the FDA would provide each company authorization to distribute a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product in the U.S., subject to various legal remedies for which the
Companies may apply including injunctive relief and damages. As previously disclosed, in March 2007, the Company was served with a Civil
Investigative Demand by the FTC requesting documents and information related to the proposed settlement. In addition, as previously disclosed, in April 2007, the Company received a subpoena from the New York State Attorney Generals Office
 Antitrust Bureau for documents related to the proposed settlement. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigations. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcomes of the investigations or their impact on the
Company. As also previously disclosed, the Companys U.S. territory partnership under its alliance with Sanofi is a plaintiff in
another pending patent infringement lawsuit instituted in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entitled Sanofi-Synthelabo, Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Holding Partnership v. Watson
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Watson Laboratories, Inc. (Watson). The suit was filed in October 2004 and was based on U.S. Patent No. 6,429,210 (the 210 Patent), which discloses and claims a particular crystalline or polymorph form of the
hydrogen sulfate salt of clopidogrel, which is marketed as PLAVIX*. The case is in the discovery phase. In December 2005, the court permitted Watson to pursue its declaratory judgment counterclaim with respect to U.S. Patent No. 6,504,030. In
January 2006, the Court approved the parties stipulation to stay this case pending the outcome of the trial in the Apotex matter. In April 2007, Pharmastar filed a request for inter partes reexamination of the 210 Patent. The U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office granted this request in July of 2007. Thus, the 210 Patent is currently under reexamination. It is not
possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcomes of the appeal by Apotex of the District courts decision, or the other PLAVIX* patent litigations or the timing of any renewed generic competition for PLAVIX* from Apotex or additional
generic competition for PLAVIX* from other third-party generic pharmaceutical companies. However, if Apotex were to prevail in an appeal of the patent litigation, the Company would expect to face renewed generic competition for PLAVIX* from Apotex
promptly thereafter. Loss of market exclusivity for PLAVIX* and/or sustained generic competition would be material to the Companys sales of PLAVIX*, results of operations and cash flows, and could be material to the Companys financial
condition and liquidity. Additionally, it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the amount of damages that could be recovered by the Company and Apotexs ability to pay such damages in the event the Company prevails in Apotexs
appeal of the District court decision. See Antitrust Litigation, Shareholder Derivative Actions and
Securities Litigation below for a further discussion of certain other U.S. litigations relating to PLAVIX*. PLAVIX* Litigation 
International PLAVIX  Canada (Apotex, Inc.) As previously disclosed, Sanofi-Synthelabo and Sanofi-Synthelabo Canada Inc. instituted a prohibition action in the Federal Court of Canada against Apotex Inc. and the Minister of Health in response to a Notice of
Allegation (NOA) from Apotex directed against Canadian Patent No. 1,336,777 (the 777 Patent) covering clopidogrel bisulfate. Apotexs NOA indicated that it had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) for clopidogrel bisulfate
tablets and that it sought approval (a Notice of Compliance) of that ANDS before the expiration of the 777 Patent, which is scheduled for August 12, 2012. Apotexs NOA further alleged that the 777 Patent was invalid or not
infringed. In March 2005, the Canadian Federal Court of Ottawa rejected Apotexs challenge to the Canadian PLAVIX* patent and held that the asserted claims are novel, not obvious and infringed, and granted Sanofis application for an order
of prohibition against the Minister of Health and Apotex. That order of prohibition precludes approval of Apotexs ANDS until the patent expires in 2012, unless the Federal Courts decision is reversed on appeal. Apotex filed an appeal,
which the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal heard on December 12-13, 2006. In December 2006, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Apotexs appeal and upheld the Federal Courts issuance of the order of prohibition. In February 2007,
Apotex filed leave to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. In July 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada granted Apotex leave to appeal the decision of the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal. BIOTECanada, the Canadian Generic
Pharmaceutical Association and Canadas Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies were granted leave to intervene. The oral hearing is scheduled for April 2008. As also previously disclosed, in April 2007, Apotex filed a lawsuit in Canada in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice entitled Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. v. Sanofi-Aventis, Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc., Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Holding Partnership, seeking a payment of $60 million, plus interest related to the break-up of the proposed settlement agreement. Defendants filed motions to dismiss on the grounds of
forum non conveniens and subject matter jurisdiction. The motions were granted on January 14, 2008.  132 
Table of ContentsNote 22 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  PLAVIX*  Canada (Cobalt) As previously disclosed, Sanofi and Sanofi-Synthelabo Canada instituted a prohibition action in the Federal Court of Canada against Cobalt and the Minister of Health in response to a NOA from Cobalt directed against
the 777 Patent and Canadian Patent No. 2,334,870 (the 870 Patent). Cobalts NOA indicated that it has filed an ANDS for clopidogrel bisulfate tablets and that it sought a Notice of Compliance for that ANDS before the expiration
of the 777 and 870 Patents. Cobalt alleged that the 777 Patent was invalid and that the 870 Patent was invalid and not infringed. The case has been stayed pending the outcome of the Apotex appeal. PLAVIX*  Korea As previously disclosed, in
June 2006, the Korean Intellectual Property Tribunal (KIPT) invalidated all claims of Sanofis Korean Patent No. 103,094, including claims directed to clopidogrel and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and to clopidogrel bisulfate, and
Sanofi appealed. In January 2008, the Patent Court affirmed the KIPT decision. The Company and Sanofi are considering its options, including an appeal. Sanofi has also commenced infringement actions against generic pharmaceutical companies, several
of which have launched a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product in Korea. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of these lawsuits or the impact on the Company. PLAVIX*  Australia As previously disclosed, Sanofi was notified that in August 2007, GenRx
Proprietary Limited (GenRx) obtained regulatory approval of an application for clopidogrel bisulfate 75mg tablets in Australia. In August 2007, GenRx filed an application in the Federal Court of Australia seeking revocation of Sanofis
Australian Patent No. 597784 (Case No. NSD 1639 of 2007). Sanofi filed counterclaims of infringement and sought an injunction. On September 21, 2007, the Australian court granted Sanofis injunction and scheduled a trial date for
April 2008. OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION ABILIFY* As previously disclosed, Otsuka has filed patent infringement actions against Teva, Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Barr), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Synthon Laboratories, Inc (Synthon), Sun Pharmaceuticals (Sun) and Apotex relating to U.S. Patent No. 5,006,528, which covers aripiprazole and expires in October 2014. Aripiprazole is comarketed by the Company and
Otsuka in the U.S. as ABILIFY*. The lawsuits are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. It is not
possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of these lawsuits or their impact on the Company. ERBITUX* Yeda Litigation In October 2003, Yeda Research and
Development Company Ltd. (Yeda) filed suit against ImClone and Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in Federal court claiming that three individuals associated with Yeda should be named as inventors of U.S. Patent No. 6,217,866 (the 866 Patent),
which covers the therapeutic combination of any EGFRspecific monoclonal antibody and anti-neoplastic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents, for use in treatment of cancer. In September 2006, following trial the Court issued an opinion and
order in which it held that three researchers at Yeda were the sole inventors of the subject matter of the 866 Patent, and giving complete ownership of the patent to Yeda. ImClone has appealed. ImClone also filed a declaratory judgment action
in the District court. The complaint alleged that if the Yeda researchers remain sole inventors of the 866 Patent, the patent is invalid. Under its commercial agreement with ImClone, the Company pays a royalty to ImClone on sales of ERBITUX*
that was not impacted by the Courts decision. Pursuant to a settlement agreement executed by ImClone, Sanofi and Yeda announced on
December 7, 2007 to end worldwide litigation related to the 866 Patent, Yeda and Sanofi granted ImClone a worldwide license under the 866 Patent, and the parties agreed that Yeda is the sole owner of the 866 Patent in the U.S.
and Yeda and Sanofi are co-owners of the 866 Patent foreign counterparts. The settlement agreement does not change ImClones worldwide royalty rate for ERBITUX* sales. Under its commercial agreement with ImClone, the Company pays a
royalty to ImClone on sales of ERBITUX* that is not impacted by the settlement agreement.  133 
Table of ContentsNote 22 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  Yeda also has the right to license the patent to others. Yedas license of the patent to third
parties could result in product competition for ERBITUX* that might not otherwise occur. It is too early to assess whether and to what extent any such competitive impact will occur or to quantify any such impact. However, Yeda has licensed the
patent to Amgen Inc. (Amgen). Amgen received FDA approval to market an EGFR product that competes with ERBITUX*. Abbott Laboratories As previously disclosed, in February 2007, Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) filed suit against ImClone in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Massachusetts alleging that ImClones manufacture and sale of ERBITUX* infringe U.S. Patent No. 5,665,578 (the 578 Patent), and seeking damages for that alleged infringement. Pursuant to settlement and sublicensing agreements
executed by ImClone and Repligen Corporation (Repligen) announced on September 10, 2007, Repligen granted ImClone a royalty-free, irrevocable worldwide sublicense for the future use of other patented technology, including the 578 Patent,
owned by Abbott and licensed to Repligen under an agreement between Abbott and Repligen. The Companys commercial agreements with ImClone include provisions pursuant to which certain financial consequences to the Company resulting from the
settlement and sublicensing agreements would be the responsibility of ImClone. The settlement and sublicensing agreements, however, do not end this lawsuit. It is not possible at this time to assess the outcome of this lawsuit or the potential impact on the Company. ORENCIA
In January 2006, Repligen and the Regents of the University of Michigan filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division. ORENCIA was launched in February 2006. The complaint alleges that the Companys then-anticipated sales of ORENCIA will infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,685,541. Repligen has since
amended the complaint to include ongoing and future sales of ORENCIA. A court-ordered mediation is scheduled for March 4, 2008, and the trial is scheduled to commence in April 2008. In August 2006, Zymogenetics, Inc. filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges
that the Companys manufacture and sales of ORENCIA infringe U.S. Patents Nos. 5,843,725 and 6,018,026. The trial is now expected to commence in 2009. PRAVACHOL In December 2006, LEK D.D. (LEK), a Slovenian generic company that is wholly-owned by Novartis, filed suit
against the Company and Watson in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall, Texas. LEKs complaint alleges that the Companys sale of PRAVACHOL and Watsons sale of an authorized generic of PRAVACHOL
infringe two patents of LEK. The patents are U.S. Patents Nos. 6,740,775, issued May 25, 2004 and 7,078,558, issued July 18, 2006. The Company filed an Answer to the Complaint in June 2007. The Company believes that it has a strong defense
to this suit and intends to defend itself vigorously. The trial is scheduled to commence in August 2009. It is not possible at this time
reasonably to assess the outcome of these lawsuits or their impact on the Company. GENERAL COMMERCIAL LITIGATION Clayworth Litigation As previously disclosed, the
Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, was named as a defendant in an action filed in California State Superior Court in Oakland, James Clayworth et al. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, et al., alleging that
the defendants conspired to fix the prices of pharmaceuticals by agreeing to charge more for their drugs in the U.S. than they charge outside the U.S., particularly Canada, and asserting claims under Californias Cartwright Act and unfair
competition law. The plaintiffs sought trebled monetary damages, injunctive relief and other relief. In December 2006, the Court granted the Company and the other manufacturers motion for summary judgment based on the pass-on defense, and
judgment was then entered in favor of defendants. In January 2007, a notice of appeal with respect to the judgment was filed and remains pending. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of this lawsuit or its impact on the
Company in the event plaintiffs are successful on appeal.  134 
Table of ContentsNote 22 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  RxUSA Wholesale Litigation As previously disclosed, in July 2006, a complaint was filed by drug wholesaler RxUSA Wholesale, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Company, 15 other drug manufacturers,
five drug wholesalers, two officers of defendant McKesson and a wholesale distribution industry trade group, RxUSA Wholesale, Inc. v. Alcon Labs., Inc., et al. The complaint alleges violations of Federal and New York antitrust laws, as well
as various other laws. Plaintiff claims that defendants allegedly engaged in anti-competitive acts that resulted in the exclusion of plaintiff from the relevant market and seeks $586 million in damages before any trebling, and other relief. The
Company, together with the other manufacturer defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the case in November 2006. That motion remains pending before the Court. It is not possible at this time reasonably to estimate the outcome of this lawsuit or the
impact on the Company. ANTITRUST LITIGATION As previously disclosed, 18 lawsuits comprised of both individual suits and purported class actions have been filed against the Company in U.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, by various plaintiffs, including
pharmacy chains (individually and as assignees, in whole or in part, of certain wholesalers), various health and welfare benefit plans/funds and individual residents of various states. These lawsuits allege, among other things, that the purported
settlement with Apotex of the patent infringement litigation violated the Sherman Act and related laws. Plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, permanent injunctive relief barring the Apotex settlement and/or monetary damages. The class actions
filed on behalf of direct purchasers have been consolidated under the caption In re: Plavix Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litigation, and the class actions filed on behalf of indirect purchasers have been consolidated under the caption In re:
Plavix Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litigation. Amended complaints were filed on October 19, 2007. Defendants filed a consolidated motion to dismiss on December 11, 2007. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome
of these lawsuits or their impact on the Company. SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS On July 31, 2007, certain members of the Board of Directors, current and former officers and the Company were named in two derivative actions filed
in the New York State Supreme Court, John Frank v. Peter Dolan, et al. (07-602580) and Donald Beebout v. Peter Dolan, et al. (07-602579), and one derivative action filed in the federal district court, Steven W. Sampson v. James D.
Robinson, III, et al. (07-CV-6890). The complaints allege breaches of fiduciary duties for allegedly failing to disclose material information relating to efforts to settle the PLAVIX* patent infringement litigation with Apotex. Plaintiffs seek
monetary damages on behalf of the Company, contribution and indemnification. By decision filed on December 13, 2007, the state court granted motions to dismiss the complaints, Frank and Beebout, relating to certain members of the
Board of Directors, but did not dismiss the complaints as to the former officers. The Company filed a motion to dismiss in the federal district court action, Sampson, which is pending. SECURITIES LITIGATION In Re Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Securities
Litigation As previously disclosed, in June and July 2007, two putative class action complaints, Minneapolis Firefighters
Relief Assoc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., et al., 07 CV 5867 and Jean Lai v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, et al., were filed in the U.S. District for the Southern District of New York against the Company, the Companys former Chief
Executive Officer, Peter Dolan and current Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Bonfield. The complaints allege violations of securities laws for allegedly failing to disclose material information relating to efforts to settle the PLAVIX* patent
infringement litigation with Apotex. On September 20, 2007, the Court dismissed the Lai case without prejudice, changed the caption of the case to In re Bristol-Myers Squibb, Co. Securities Litigation, and appointed Ontario
Teachers Pension Plan Board as lead plaintiff. On October 15, 2007, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board filed an amended complaint making similar allegations as the earlier filed complaints, but no longer naming Andrew Bonfield as a
defendant. Motions to dismiss have been filed. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this litigation. It is not possible at
this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these lawsuits, or the potential impact on the Company.  135 
Table of ContentsNote 22 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  PRICING, SALES AND PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS As previously disclosed, the Company, together with a number of defendants, is a defendant in a number of private civil matters relating to its pricing
practices. In addition, the Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, has received subpoenas and other document requests from various government agencies seeking records relating to its pricing, sales, marketing
practices and best price reporting. On September 28, 2007, the Company, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the U.S.
Attorney for the District of Massachusetts finalized the previously disclosed agreement in principle to settle several investigations involving the Companys drug pricing, sales and marketing activities. The settlement agreement, which provides
for a civil resolution, resolves matters that have been actively investigated by and discussed with the DOJ and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts over a number of years, including matters relating to: (1) the pricing for
certain products sold several years ago by a subsidiary, which had been reimbursed by governmental health care programs; 2) financial relationships between that subsidiary and certain customers and other entities; 3) certain consulting programs; 4)
the promotion of ABILIFY* for unapproved indications; 5) the calculation of certain Medicaid rebates for SERZONE (nefazodone hydrochloride); and 6) the pricing for certain of the Companys products reimbursed by governmental health care
programs. There will be no criminal charges against the Company with respect to those matters. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed to pay $499 million plus interest to resolve the Federal and state claims, resulting in a total amount of
approximately $516 million as of the settlement date. The Company has paid the federal portion of the global settlement, approximately $317 million plus interest. The state portion of the global settlement, approximately $182 million, plus interest,
will not be disbursed unless and until the states approve the settlement. There can be no assurances that any or all states will approve the settlement. In connection with the settlement, the Company has entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity
Agreement with the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The settlement only covers those matters outlined above, and the DOJ, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and the states have
indicated that they may pursue other matters outside the scope of the settlement, and in that event, such matters could result in the assertion of civil and/or criminal claims. Also as previously disclosed, as a result of the agreement in principle, the Company had recorded aggregate reserves in the amount of $499 million plus
interest for these matters. With payment of the federal portion of the global settlement now having been made, the remaining reserve at December 31, 2007 was $182 million plus interest. If certain states choose not to participate, the amount
reserved may not reflect eventual losses. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of any additional matters that
the DOJ and the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts may pursue, or the potential impact on the Company. Litigation
As previously disclosed, the Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, is a defendant in private class
actions, as well as suits brought by the attorneys general of numerous states, many New York counties, and the City of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs allege defendants caused the Average Wholesale Prices (AWPs) of their products to be
inflated, thereby injuring government programs, entities and persons who reimbursed prescription drugs based on AWPs. Twelve state attorneys general suits are pending in federal and state courts around the country. A case in Alabama state
court is scheduled to be the first to proceed to trial in February 2008. One set of class actions, a suit by the Arizona attorney general and several suits filed by New York Counties and the City of New York, have been consolidated in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Massachusetts (AWP MDL). The Court in the AWP MDL has certified three classes of persons and entities who paid for or reimbursed for seven of the Companys physician-administered drugs. In June 2007, in a
non-jury trial in the AWP MDL, the Court found the Company liable for violations of Massachusetts consumer protection laws with respect to certain oncology drugs for certain years and awarded damages in the amount of $183 thousand for Class 3
(private third-party payors) and instructed the parties to apply the Courts opinion to determine damages for Class 2 (Medigap insurers). In August, 2007, the Court found damages of $187 thousand for Class 2. The Company has appealed the June
2007 decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. As previously disclosed, in June 2007, the Company settled in principle the claims of Class 1 (Medicare Part B beneficiaries nationwide) for $13 million, plus half the costs of class
notice up to a maximum payment of $1 million and the parties are finalizing the terms of the settlement. A hearing will be scheduled thereafter for preliminary approval of the Class 1 settlement. The Company has recorded reserves of $14 million for these matters. In accordance with GAAP, the reserve reflects the Companys estimate of probable
loss with respect to these matters, assuming the settlement is finalized. If the settlement is not finalized, the amount reserved may not reflect eventual losses. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of the litigation
matters described above, or their potential impact on the Company.  136 
Table of ContentsNote 22 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION The Company is a party to various product liability lawsuits. In addition to lawsuits, the Company also faces unfiled claims involving other products. At this time, the Company does not believe that any of the
on-going matters or the potential unfiled claims of which it is aware have the potential to result in a material effect on the Companys financial results or operations. ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS As previously reported, the Company is a party to several environmental
proceedings and other matters, and is responsible under various state, Federal and foreign laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, (CERCLA), for certain costs of investigating and/or remediating
contamination resulting from past industrial activity at the Companys current or former sites or at waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties. CERCLA Matters With respect to CERCLA matters for which the Company is responsible under various
state, Federal and foreign laws, the Company typically estimates potential costs based on information obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or counterpart state agency and/or studies prepared by independent consultants,
including the total estimated costs for the site and the expected cost-sharing, if any, with other potentially responsible parties, and the Company accrues liabilities when they are probable and reasonably estimable. As of
December 31, 2007, the Company estimated its share of the total future costs for these sites to be approximately $69 million, recorded as other liabilities, which represents the sum of best estimates or, where no simple estimate can
reasonably be made, estimates of the minimal probable amount among a range of such costs (without taking into account any potential recoveries from other parties, which are not currently expected). Puerto Rico Air Emissions Civil Litigation As
previously disclosed, the Company is one of several defendants in a class action suit filed in Superior Court in Puerto Rico relating to air emissions from a government-owned and operated wastewater treatment facility. The Court certified the class
on August 9, 2007 and on August 15, 2007 the parties executed a global settlement agreement, resolving all claims in the litigation. A hearing to approve the settlement was held on October 26, 2007. Under the terms of the settlement,
certain measures, including capital improvements, will be implemented at the wastewater treatment facility to minimize the potential for future odor emissions. The Companys share of the payment to plaintiffs will be approximately $700
thousand. On November 6, 2007, the court entered Final Judgment approving the settlement. This concludes the Companys involvement in the litigation, except for the Companys payment of its share of the cost of the capital
improvements, which will be finalized in early 2008. Passaic River (NJ) Remediation and Natural Resource Damages Claims As previously disclosed, in September 2003, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) issued an administrative enforcement Directive
requiring the Company and other companies to perform an assessment of natural resource damages and to implement unspecified interim remedial measures to restore conditions in the Lower Passaic River (LPR). The Directive named the Company due to
releases from a nearby bulk chemical reprocessing facility operated by a predecessor of McKesson Corp. Subsequently, the EPA issued a notice letter to numerous parties, but not the Company, requesting performance of a Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) of conditions in the LPR. Under a consent agreement with EPA in 2004, a group of these other parties committed to pay roughly half of the $20 million estimated for the RI/FS by EPA at that time. The EPA
thereafter substantially increased its estimate of the scope and cost of the RI/FS and, as a result, the EPA agreed to allow the group to perform most of the remaining RI/FS tasks. By the groups estimate, total costs to complete the RI/FS and
related tasks now exceed $50 million. The group has negotiated an amended consent agreement with the EPA to conduct the remaining RI/FS work, which became effective in May 2007. As part of that deal, the Company and McKesson have bought out of
remaining RI/FS tasks. Separately, the Company has agreed to pay approximately $110 thousand towards RI/FS tasks previously funded by
McKesson and work cooperatively going forward. In addition, in mid-2007 the EPA announced plans to seek implementation of early-action remedial measures to address the most highly-contaminated portions of the LPR while the RI/FS is being
completed. The EPA has indicated it expects to select any such actions early in 2008. Also, a group of federal natural resource trustee agencies have proposed that the private party group enter into an agreement to assess natural resource damages in
the LPR. The group expects to discuss the proposal with the trustees in the near future. The extent of any liability the Company may face for these and related requirements cannot yet be determined.  137 
Table of ContentsNote 22 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  North Brunswick Township Board of Education As previously disclosed, in October 2003, the Company was contacted by counsel representing the North Brunswick, NJ Board of Education (BOE) regarding a
site where waste materials from E.R. Squibb and Sons may have been disposed from the 1940s through the 1960s. Fill material containing industrial waste and heavy metals in excess of residential standards was discovered during an
expansion project at the North Brunswick Township High School, as well as at a number of neighboring residential properties and adjacent public park areas. In January 2004, the NJDEP sent the Company and others an information request letter about
possible waste disposal at the site, to which the Company responded in March 2004. The BOE and the Township, who are the current owners of the school property and the park, are conducting and jointly financing soil remediation work and ground water
investigation work under a work plan approved by NJDEP, and have asked the Company to contribute to the cost. Due to financial constraints, in late 2004 the BOE asked the Company to contribute funds on an interim basis to assure uninterrupted
performance of necessary site work. The Company continues to actively monitor the clean-up project, including its costs. To date, neither the school board nor the Township has asserted any claim against the Company. Instead, the Company and the
local entities have negotiated an agreement to attempt to resolve the matter by mediation; a central component of the anticipated agreement is provision by the Company of interim funding to help defray cleanup costs. The agreement has been executed
by all parties, and the Company has transmitted an initial interim funding payment in January 2008. The parties have recently commenced work to prepare for mediation, which is expected to conclude by mid-2008. ODS Regulatory Compliance As previously disclosed,
the EPA is investigating industrial and commercial facilities throughout the U.S. that use refrigeration equipment containing ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and enforcing compliance with regulations governing the prevention, service and repair of
leaks (ODS requirements). In 2004, the Company performed a voluntary corporate-wide audit at its facilities in the U.S. and Puerto Rico that use ODS-containing refrigeration equipment. The Company submitted an audit report to the EPA in November
2004, identifying potential violations of the ODS requirements at several of its facilities. In addition to the matters covered in the Companys audit report letter to the EPA, the EPA previously sent the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary,
Mead Johnson, a request for information regarding compliance with ODS requirements at its facility in Evansville, Indiana. The Company responded to the request in June 2004, and, as a result, identified potential violations at the Evansville
facility. The Company currently is in discussions with the EPA to resolve both the potential violations discovered during the audit and those identified as a result of the EPA request for information to the Evansville facility. If the EPA determines
that the Evansville facility, or any other facilities, was, or is, in violation of applicable ODS requirements, the Company could be subject to penalties and/or be required to convert or replace refrigeration equipment to use non-ODS approved
substitutes. MACT CompliancePuerto Rico Facilities (Barceloneta and Humacao) As previously disclosed, in March 2005, the Company commenced a voluntary environmental audit of the Barceloneta and Humacao, Puerto Rico facilities to
determine their compliance with EPAs regulations regarding the maximum achievable control technology requirements for emissions of hazardous air pollutants from pharmaceuticals production (Pharmaceutical MACT). The Company submitted to EPA an
audit report for the Humacao facility in June 2005 and for the Barceloneta facility in July 2005, which disclosed potential violations of the Pharmaceutical MACT requirements at both facilities. The Company and the EPA are currently in discussions
regarding resolution of this matter. WAGE & HOUR LITIGATION As previously disclosed, two putative class action complaints have been filed against the Company by former sales representatives. In Kin Fung, et al. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, et al., (Case Number RG07333147), filed in June 2007 in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda, the plaintiff alleges that
the Company violated California wage and hour laws by, among other things, not paying overtime compensation to him and a putative class of similarly situated sales employees. Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on September 24, 2007 to add a
cause of action for penalties under California Labor Code §2699, the Private Attorney General Act. California Labor Code §2699 allows a plaintiff to collect civil penalties for violations of any provision of the California Labor Code, 75%
of which is collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. California Labor Code §2699 has a one-year statute of limitations, and allows for the recovery of a penalty for each outstanding violation per pay period, and could be
interpreted to require a penalty per employee per pay period. On January 4, 2008, the Court dismissed the Kin Fung matter in its entirety due to Mr. Fungs assertion that he did not wish to participate as plaintiff in the
matter. In Beth Amendola v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, et al. (Docket No. 07-CV-6088), filed in June 2007 in the District
court, the plaintiff alleges that the Company violated the federal Fair Labor Standards Act by, among other things, not paying overtime compensation to her and a putative class of similarly situated sales employees. The parties are currently engaged
in preliminary discovery in the Amendola matter.  138 
Table of ContentsNote 22 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these lawsuits. As the above matters are in the
very early stages of litigation, it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of the litigation matters described above, but it is not expected that their outcome would be material to the Companys results of operations and
cash flows, or be material to its financial condition and liquidity. OTHER PROCEEDINGS SEC Germany Investigation As previously disclosed, in
October 2004, the SEC notified the Company that it is conducting an informal inquiry into the activities of certain of the Companys German pharmaceutical subsidiaries and its employees and/or agents. On October 4, 2006, the SEC informed
the Company that its inquiry is now formal. The SECs inquiry encompasses matters currently under investigation by the German prosecutor in Munich, Germany. The Company understands the inquiry and investigation concern potential violations of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and German law, respectively. The Company is cooperating with both the SEC and the German authorities. The Company has established an accrual which represents minimum expected probable losses with respect to the
investigation by the German prosecutor. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of these investigations or their impact on the Company. Bari, Italy Investigation As previously disclosed, in January 2006, the Company was notified by the Prosecutor in the Bari
region of Italy (Bari Prosecutor) that the Company was under investigation as a result of the activities of two of its employees in the region. The investigation also involved a number of doctors, pharmacists, pharmaceutical companies and their
sales representatives. The main allegation was that the parties were engaged in a plan to defraud the National Health Service, and that the companies lacked appropriate compliance controls and/or processes and procedures to control the activities of
their sales representatives. In February 2007, the Company and the Bari Prosecutor reached an agreement in principle to settle the matter. The agreement requires final approval by the Civil Court, and a final hearing in the matter should occur
during 2008. The Company has paid an administrative fine in an amount which is not material to the Company. ConvaTec  Italy Investigation 
The Italian competition authorities investigated a complaint lodged by a hospital in the Ferrara region of Italy relating to an allegation
that four medical device companies, including ConvaTec, boycotted tenders in 2003 and 2004 (the Ferrara tenders). ConvaTec responded to the allegations earlier this year. In May 2007, ConvaTec received a statement of objections from the Italian
competition authorities, whereby the authorities alleged that four medical device companies, including ConvaTec, acted in a concerted manner with regard not only to the Ferrara tenders, but tenders or pricing discussions in three other regions and
acted in such a way to prevent competition throughout Italy. A hearing on the matter was held in July 2007. In August 2007, the competition authorities issued their decision, and found that the four medical device companies had infringed Italian
anti-trust law by not participating in the Ferrara tenders, and imposed a fine of 2,345,200 against ConvaTec. (As ConvaTec is a division of BMS Italy, the fine was imposed against BMS Italy). The fine is based on ConvaTecs market share
and turnover in 2004. The other companies also were fined, but the amounts were smaller. ConvaTec has appealed the decision to the Administrative Court. A hearing on the appeal is expected in early or mid 2008, with a decision likely to issue soon
thereafter. Note 23 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In December 2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Avista for the sale of its Medical Imaging business, for a purchase price of approximately $525 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The
closing of the transaction was completed on January 7, 2008. The Company expects to recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $20 million to $40 million ($30 million to $50 million loss net of tax) in the first quarter of 2008, subject to the
post-closing adjustments. On February 21, 2008, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of an administrative facility in Paris,
France for approximately 155 million. The Company expects to record a gain, of which the majority will be deferred and will reduce future lease rental costs over the lease period.  139

Table of Contents
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained
earnings, and cash flows for the years then ended. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for
the year ended December 31, 2005, before the effects of the retrospective adjustments for the discontinued operations of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging (MI) business discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements, were audited by other auditors whose report, dated March 13, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We have also audited the retrospective adjustments to the 2005 consolidated financial statements for the operations of MI which were discontinued in 2007, as discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements. Our procedures included (1) obtaining the Companys underlying accounting analysis prepared by management of the retrospective adjustments for discontinued operations and comparing the retrospectively adjusted amounts per the
2005 consolidated financial statements to such analysis, (2) comparing previously reported amounts to the previously issued consolidated financial statements for such year, (3) testing the mathematical accuracy of the accounting analysis,
and (4) comparing the adjustments to retrospectively adjust the consolidated financial statements for discontinued operations to the Companys supporting documentation. In our opinion, such retrospective adjustments are appropriate and
have been properly applied. However, we were not engaged to audit, review or apply any procedures to the 2005 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to the retrospective adjustments and, accordingly, we do not
express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2005 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. As discussed in Notes 1,
8, 17 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109, effective January 1, 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006, and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), effective December 31, 2006. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based
on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company: In our opinion, the consolidated statements
of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005, before the effects of the adjustments to retrospectively reflect the discontinued operations described in Note 5, present fairly, in
all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (the 2005 consolidated financial statements before the effects of the adjustments discussed in Note 5 are not presented herein). In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule for the year ended December 31, 2005, before
the effects of the adjustments to retrospectively reflect the discontinued operations described in Note 1 to the financial statement schedule, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements referred to above (the financial statement schedule for the year ended December 31, 2005 before the effects of the adjustments discussed in Note 1 to the financial statement schedule is not
presented herein). These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audit. We conducted our audit, before the effects of the adjustments described above, of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the adjustments to retrospectively reflect the discontinued operations described in Note 5 to the
financial statements and Note 1 to the financial statement schedule and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. Those adjustments were
audited by other auditors.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 







NOTE 1.  


SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



 

Principles
    of Consolidation

 

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Rowan Companies, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
    hereinafter referred to as Rowan or the
    Company. Intercompany balances and transactions are
    eliminated in consolidation.

 

Discontinued
    Operations

 

    On December 31, 2004, Rowan completed the sale of its
    aviation operations as conducted by Era Aviation, Inc. In
    February 2005, Rowan sold the purchase options it held on four
    leased anchor-handling boats. The leases covering the
    Companys two remaining boats expired during the second
    quarter of 2005, when they were returned to the lessor and Rowan
    exited the marine vessel business.

 

    The revenues and expenses resulting from Rowans
    discontinued aviation and marine vessel operations for the three
    years ended December 31, 2007, including the gain or loss
    recognized upon their sale, are shown collectively and net of
    tax as Income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. See Note 12 for further
    information regarding the Companys discontinued operations.

 

Goodwill
    and Intangibles

 

    Rowan had goodwill with a carrying value of $12.4 million
    at each of December 31, 2007 and 2006, of which
    $10.9 million related to the Drilling Products and Systems
    segment and $1.5 million related to the drilling division.
    Goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually.
    At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had intangible
    assets subject to amortization totaling $1.0 million and
    $1.2 million, respectively.

 

Revenue
    and Expense Recognition

 

    Rowans drilling contracts generally provide for payment on
    a day rate basis, and revenues are recognized as the work
    progresses. Rowan frequently collects up-front fees to reimburse
    the Company for the cost of relocating its drilling equipment,
    and occasionally receives reimbursement for equipment
    modifications and upgrades requested by its customers. Such fees
    and reimbursements, and any related costs, are deferred and
    subsequently recognized in operations on a straight-line basis
    over the period that the drilling services are performed.
    Deferred drilling revenues included in current and other
    liabilities were $80.1 million and $60.9 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deferred drilling
    costs included in prepaid expenses and other assets were
    $53.7 million and $48.8 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Rowan also typically receives
    reimbursement for certain rebillable costs, which
    are recognized as both revenues and expenses when incurred.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS  (Continued)

 

    Manufacturing sales and related costs are generally recognized
    when title passes as products are shipped. Revenues from
    long-term manufacturing projects such as rigs and rig kits are
    recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using costs
    incurred relative to total estimated project costs. The Company
    does not recognize any estimated profit until such projects are
    at least 10% complete, though full provision is made immediately
    for any anticipated losses. The following table summarizes the
    status of Rowans long-term construction projects in
    progress, including any advance payments received for projects
    not yet begun (in thousands):

    sales and costs of sales of $689.9 million and
    $561.0 million, $421.4 million and
    $345.6 million, and $270.9 million and
    $231.1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

 

    Included in Receivables at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are
    costs related to the salvage of lost or damaged rigs and related
    equipment. See Note 9 for additional information regarding
    the Companys salvage operations and related insurance
    reimbursements.

 

Income
    Per Common Share

 

    Basic income per share is determined as income
    available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average
    number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Diluted income per share reflects the issuance of
    additional shares in connection with the assumed conversion of
    stock options and other convertible securities, and
    corresponding adjustments to income for any charges related to
    such securities.

Statement
    of Cash Flows

 

    Rowan invests only in highly liquid U.S. Government
    securities, bank time deposits, A1/P1-rated commercial paper,
    money market preferred stock custodial receipts or repurchase
    agreements with terms no greater than three months, all of which
    are considered to be cash equivalents.

 

    Noncash investing and financing activities excluded from the
    Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows were as
    follows: in 2007  the reduction of $1,655,000 of tax
    benefits related to employee stock options, the conversion of
    $2,289,000 of Series A and C employee debentures into
    78,707 shares of common stock and $15,911,000 of accrued
    property and equipment additions; in 2006  the
    conversion of $1,000,000 of Series B employee debentures
    into 71,112 shares of common stock, the reduction of
    $2,380,000 of tax benefits related to employee stock options and
    $30,171,000 of accrued property and equipment additions; in
    2005  the conversion of $500,000 of Series B
    employee debentures into 35,556 shares of common stock, the
    reduction of $9,990,000 of tax benefits related to employee
    stock options and $8,159,000 of accrued property and equipment
    additions.

 

Inventories

 

    Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. Costs
    include labor, material and production overhead. Management
    periodically reviews inventory for obsolescence and reserves for
    items unlikely to be sold.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS  (Continued)

 

    Rowans adoption, effective January 1, 2006, of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, which
    clarifies the distinction between costs that are allocable to
    inventory and those that are expensed as incurred, did not
    materially impact its financial position or results of
    operations.

 

Property
    and Depreciation

 

    Rowan provides depreciation under the straight-line method from
    the date an asset is placed into service until it is sold or
    becomes fully depreciated based on the following estimated lives
    and salvage values:

    Expenditures for new property or enhancements to existing
    property are capitalized and depreciated over the assets
    estimated useful life. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
    are charged to operations as incurred. As assets are sold or
    retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation amounts
    are removed and any resulting gain or loss is included in the
    Companys results of operations. Rowan capitalizes, during
    the construction period, a portion of interest cost incurred.
    See Note 10 for further information regarding the
    Companys depreciation and amortization, capital
    expenditures and repairs and maintenance. Long-lived assets are
    reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate their
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable, based upon estimated
    future cash flows.

 

Environmental
    Matters

 

    Environmental remediation costs are accrued using estimates of
    future monitoring, testing and
    clean-up
    costs where it is probable that such costs will be incurred.
    Estimates of future monitoring, testing and
    clean-up
    costs and assessments of the probability that such costs will be
    incurred incorporate many factors, including: approved
    monitoring, testing
    and/or
    remediation plans; ongoing communications with environmental
    regulatory agencies; the expected duration of remediation
    measures; historical monitoring, testing and
    clean-up
    costs and current and anticipated operational plans and
    manufacturing processes. Ongoing environmental compliance costs
    are expensed as incurred and expenditures to mitigate or prevent
    future environmental contamination are capitalized. The
    Companys reserves for environmental remediation costs at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 were not material. See
    Note 9 for further information regarding the Companys
    environmental liabilities.

 

Income
    Taxes

 

    Rowan recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for
    the estimated future tax consequences of differences between the
    financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
    Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets
    that are not likely to be realized. See Note 7 for further
    information regarding the Companys income tax assets and
    liabilities.

Foreign
    Currency Transactions

 

    The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of
    Rowans operations. All realized and unrealized foreign
    currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in the
    Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. In order
    to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, Rowan
    generally requires customer payments to be primarily in
    U.S. dollars.

 

Comprehensive
    Income 

 

    Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other
    comprehensive income. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, Rowan
    recognized other comprehensive income or loss relating to
    pension and other benefit liabilities. See Note 6 for
    further information regarding the Companys pension and
    other benefit liabilities.

 

Management
    Estimates

 

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    amount of debenture through September 20, 2011.

 

    All of the Companys outstanding subordinated convertible
    debentures were originally issued in exchange for promissory
    notes containing provisions for setoff, protecting Rowan against
    any credit risk. Accordingly, the debentures and notes, and the
    related interest amounts, have been offset in the consolidated
    financial statements pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 39. See Note 3 for further
    information regarding the Companys convertible debenture
    incentive plans.

 

    Rowan weighted average annual interest rate was 5.2% at
    December 31, 2007 and 5.0% at December 31, 2006. Cash
    interest payments exceeded interest capitalized by
    $17.0 million in 2007, $20.3 million in 2006, and
    $20.6 million in 2005.

 

    Rowans debt agreements contain provisions that require
    minimum levels of working capital and stockholders equity
    and limit the amount of long-term debt, and, in the event of
    noncompliance, restrict investment activities, asset purchases
    and sales, lease obligations, borrowings and mergers or
    acquisitions. These agreements also contain

    minimum insurance requirements for the Companys
    collateralized drilling rigs. The extent of hurricane damage
    sustained throughout the Gulf Coast area in recent years has
    dramatically increased the cost and reduced the availability of
    insurance coverage for windstorm losses and, during its 2006
    policy renewal, the Company determined that windstorm coverage
    meeting these requirements was cost-prohibitive. Thus, the
    Company requested and received from MARAD a waiver of any
    defaults related to insurance requirements and provided
    additional security to MARAD, including restricted and
    unrestricted cash balances. Effective March 30, 2007, in
    connection with the Companys 2007 policy renewal, the
    additional security provisions were modified and the minimum
    restricted cash balance was reduced from $156.1 million to
    $50 million. This amount is maintained in a separate
    account in which MARAD has a security interest and is shown
    separately as Restricted cash on the Companys Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. In addition, the Companys unrestricted cash
    requirement was reduced from $100 million to
    $31 million. The Company remains subject to restrictions on
    the use of certain insurance proceeds should it experience
    further losses. Each of these additional security provisions
    will be released by MARAD if Rowan obtains windstorm coverage
    that satisfies the Companys existing debt requirements.
    The Company believes that it was in compliance with each of its
    debt covenants at December 31, 2007. See Note 5 for
    further information regarding the Companys dividend
    restrictions.

 







NOTE 3.  


STOCKHOLDERS
    EQUITY



 

    Rowans 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
    authorizes the Companys Board of Directors to issue,
    through April 22, 2015, up to 3,400,000 shares of
    Rowan common stock in a variety of forms, including stock
    options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
    shares, stock appreciation rights and common stock grants, whose
    terms are governed by the LTIP. The LTIP replaced and superseded
    the Restated 1988 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, as amended,
    and the 1998 Nonemployee Directors Stock Option Plan. At
    December 31, 2007, awards covering 1,160,607 shares
    had been made under the LTIP, net of forfeitures, as follows:
    319,180 in 2007, 312,718 in 2006 and 528,709 in 2005.

 

    Restricted stock represents a full share of Rowan common stock
    issued with a restrictive legend that prevents its sale until
    the restriction is later removed. The restrictions will
    generally lapse pro rata over a three or four-year service
    period. The Company measures total compensation related to each
    share based upon the market value of the common stock on the
    date of the award and recognizes the resulting expense on a
    straight-line basis over the service period. The following table
    summarizes restricted stock awards made under the LTIP to
    approximately 100 key employees over the past three years and
    the amount of related compensation accrued at December 31,
    2007 (dollars in millions):

    Restricted stock units are awards that may be settled through
    the issuance of Rowan common stock or the payment of cash where
    vesting generally occurs over a defined service period but the
    restriction lapses only upon termination of service. The Company
    measures compensation related to each unit based upon the market
    value of the underlying common stock on the date of the award
    and recognizes the resulting expense on a straight-line basis
    over the service period. During 2005, Rowan issued 36,900
    restricted stock units to its nonemployee directors, with an
    average fair value of $25.12 per unit. During 2006, Rowan issued
    15,000 restricted stock units to its nonemployee directors, with
    an average fair value of $43.41 per unit, and issued
    8,890 shares of Rowan common stock in settlement of
    previous restricted stock unit awards and related dividends.
    During 2007, Rowan issued

    STATEMENTS  (Continued)

 

    29,000 restricted stock units to its nonemployee directors, with
    an average fair value of $38.31 per unit. At December 31,
    2007, Rowan had accrued $2.1 million toward future
    settlement of restricted stock units.

 

    Performance shares are shares of Rowan common stock whose future
    issuance is contingent upon the achievement of certain
    performance criteria. During 2005, the Company awarded 99,500
    performance shares to 12 key employees, under which as many as
    199,000 (and as few as zero) shares of Rowan common stock will
    be issued in May 2008 depending upon the Companys total
    stockholder return (TSR) in comparison to a selected industry
    peer group over the three-year period then ended. The Company
    measures and recognizes compensation expense at each period end
    using the market value of the common stock on the date of the
    award and the expected number of shares to be issued based upon
    Rowans relative TSR performance. Compensation expense of
    approximately $0.5 million was recognized during 2007 and
    no compensation expense was recognized during 2005 and 2006.

 

    During 2006, the Company awarded 115,791 performance shares to
    15 key employees, under which as many as 231,582 (and as few as
    zero) shares of Rowan common stock will be issued in April 2009
    based upon an equal weighting of the Companys TSR and
    return on investment (ROI) ranking versus a selected industry
    peer group over the three-year period then ended. With respect
    to the TSR metric, the Company estimated a fair value of $42.51
    per share, which is being recognized as compensation expense
    over the three-year performance period. The total related
    compensation was measured at $2.5 million, of which
    $1.4 million had been recognized at December 31, 2007.
    With respect to the ROI metric, the Company estimated
    compensation expense using the market value of the common stock
    on the date of the award of $43.85 per share and the target
    number of shares to be issued. Compensation expense is
    re-measured annually using the expected number of shares to be
    issued based upon Rowans relative ROI performance.
    Compensation expense of $0.6 million recognized in 2006 was
    reversed following re-measurement in 2007.

 

    During 2007, the Company awarded 91,068 performance shares to 6
    key employees, under which as many as 182,136 (and as few as
    zero) shares of Rowan common stock will be issued in May 2010
    based upon an equal weighting of the Companys TSR and
    return on investment (ROI) ranking versus a selected industry
    peer group over the three-year period then ended. With respect
    to the TSR metric, the Company estimated a fair value of $36.88
    per share, which is being recognized as compensation expense
    over the three-year performance period. The total related
    compensation was measured at $1.7 million, of which
    $0.4 million had been recognized at December 31, 2007.
    With respect to the ROI metric, the Company estimated
    compensation expense using the market value of the common stock
    on the date of the award of $38.70 per share and the target
    number of shares to be issued. The total related compensation
    was measured at $1.8 million, of which $0.4 million
    had been recognized at December 31, 2007. Compensation
    expense will be re-measured annually using the expected number
    of shares to be issued based upon Rowans relative ROI
    performance. During 2007, 20,811 of previously awarded
    performance shares were forfeited.

ROWAN
    COMPANIES, INC.


 

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS  (Continued)

 

    At December 31, 2007, Rowan had $1.4 million of
    unrecognized future compensation expense related to stock
    options.

 

    On January 1, 2006, Rowan adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
    2004) Share-Based Payment, as amended
    (Statement 123R), which requires recognition as
    expense over future service or vesting periods of stock-based
    compensation cost measured based upon grant date fair value.
    Prior to 2006, Rowan accounted for stock-based compensation in
    accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
    No. 25, whereby cost was measured based upon intrinsic
    value, or the difference, if any, between the quoted market
    price on the date of grant and the amount the employee was
    required to pay for the common stock. Accordingly, Rowan did not
    recognize compensation expense for stock options having an
    exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant.

 

    Rowan applied the modified prospective method of adoption,
    whereby the provisions of Statement 123R are applied to all
    stock-based awards made on or after January 1, 2006 and any
    outstanding but unvested awards as of that date. Accordingly,
    the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 have not been restated
    to give effect to Statement 123R. In addition, there was no
    material cumulative effect to be recognized upon adoption of
    Statement 123R. The adoption of Statement 123R did impact the
    Companys Stockholders equity components as the
    $4.7 million balance of Unearned equity compensation, which
    originated in connection with the 2005 restricted stock awards,
    was reclassified to, and reduced the balance of, Additional
    paid-in capital effective January 1, 2006.

 

    During 2007, Rowan recognized stock-based compensation expense
    of $9.3 million under Statement 123R, including
    $2.5 million related to stock options, $5.7 million
    related to restricted stock and units and $1.1 million
    related to performance shares. Rowan estimates that the
    provisions of Statement 123R reduced the Companys net
    income by approximately $1.6 million or $.01 per share
    during 2007. During 2006, Rowan recognized stock-based
    compensation expense of $12.5 million under Statement 123R,
    including $7.2 million related to stock options,
    $4.2 million related to restricted stock and units and
    $1.1 million related to performance shares. Rowan estimates
    that the provisions of Statement 123R reduced the Companys
    net income by approximately $3.2 million or $.03 per share
    during 2006. The following table illustrates the estimated
    effects of Statement 123R on the Companys total and per

    Under the Rowan Companies, Inc. 1998 Convertible Debenture
    Incentive Plan, as amended, floating-rate subordinated
    convertible debentures totaling $30 million were issued by
    the Company. The debentures are initially convertible into
    preferred stock, which has no voting rights (except as required
    by law or the Companys charter), no dividend and a nominal
    liquidation preference. The preferred stock is immediately
    convertible into common stock. At December 31, 2007,
    $3.5 million of the $4.8 million principal amount of
    Series A debentures issued in 1998, $3.0 million of
    the $4.8 million principal amount of Series B
    debentures issued in 1999, $8.6 million of the
    $9.6 million principal amount of Series C debentures
    issued in 2000, all $9.6 million principal amount of
    Series D debentures issued in 2001 and all
    $1.2 million principal amount of Series E debentures
    issued in 2001 were outstanding. The outstanding Series A,
    B, C, D and E debentures are collectively convertible into
    1,027,011 shares of Rowans common stock.

 

    In 1992, Rowan adopted a Stockholder Rights Agreement to protect
    against coercive takeover tactics. The agreement, as amended,
    provides for the distribution to Rowans stockholders of
    one Right for each outstanding share of common stock. Each Right
    entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one
    one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Preferred Stock
    of Rowan at an exercise price of $80. In addition, under certain
    circumstances, each Right will entitle the holder to purchase
    securities of Rowan or an acquiring entity at one-half market
    value. The Rights are exercisable only if a person or group
    knowingly acquires 15% or more of Rowans outstanding
    common stock or makes a tender offer for 30% or more of the
    Companys outstanding common stock. The Rights will expire
    on January 24, 2012.

    The balance in Deferred revenues primarily reflects customer
    prepayments for products and services to be provided and
    lump-sum mobilization fees to be recognized during the next
    year. The balance also included $23.4 million at
    December 31, 2006 related to the sale of the
    Rowan-Midland. See Note 13 for further information
    regarding the sale of the Rowan-Midland.

 

    The balance in Compensation and related employee costs includes
    estimated pension and other benefit plan funding contributions
    to be provided during the next year, which totaled
    $33 million at December 31, 2007 and

    $15 million at December 31, 2006. See Note 6 for
    further information regarding the Companys pension and
    other benefit plans.

 

    Taxes and other included accrued manufacturing warranty claims
    of $7.1 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $5.1 million at December 31, 2006. The balance at
    December 31, 2006 also included $9.0 million provided
    for fines and environmental fund payments made in 2007 in
    settlement of a Department of Justice investigation. See
    Note 9 for further information regarding the Companys
    environmental matters.

 







NOTE 5.  


RESTRICTIONS
    ON RETAINED EARNINGS



 

    Rowans Title XI debt agreements contain financial
    covenants that limit the amount the Company may distribute to
    its stockholders. Under the most restrictive of such covenants,
    Rowan had approximately $253 million of retained earnings
    available for distribution at December 31, 2007. Subject to
    this and other restrictions, the Board of Directors will
    determine payment, if any, of future dividends or distributions
    in light of conditions then existing, including the
    Companys earnings, financial condition and requirements,
    opportunities for reinvesting earnings, business conditions and
    other factors. See Note 14 for further information
    regarding the Companys dividends.

 







NOTE 6.  


BENEFIT
    PLANS



 

    Since 1952, Rowan has sponsored defined benefit pension plans
    covering substantially all of its employees. In addition, Rowan
    provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain
    retired employees.

 

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158
    Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, which required that the funded
    status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans be
    fully recognized in our December 31, 2006 Consolidated
    Balance Sheet, had the effect of increasing our balances for
    Other liabilities, Deferred income taxes and Accumulated other
    comprehensive loss at that date by $67.1 million,
    $23.5 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Though
    balance sheet recognition is now required for the unamortized
    portion of gains and losses, prior service cost and transition
    assets, such amounts will continue to be excluded from net
    periodic benefits cost and included within other comprehensive
    income (loss).

    The pension plans have target allocations for plan investments
    that attempt to diversify assets among equity securities
    (60-80%) and
    fixed income and cash
    (20-40%) and
    reduce performance volatility. The target allocation to equities
    is further subdivided among the S&P index
    (15-25%),
    large cap value (5-15%), large cap growth (5-15%), small cap
    (5-15%), international
    (10-30%) and
    the Companys stock (0-5%). The plans employ several active
    managers with proven long-term out-performance in their specific
    investment discipline and periodically reallocate assets in
    accordance with the allocation targets. The plans will attempt
    to remain fully invested and limit the amount of cash on hand.

 

    To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
    assumption, Rowan considered the current level of expected
    returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds),
    the historical level of the risk premium associated with the
    plans other asset classes and the expectations for future
    returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset
    class was then weighted based upon the current asset allocation
    to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
    assumption for the Plans, which was maintained at 8% at
    December 31, 2007, unchanged from December 31, 2006.

    Rowan currently expects to contribute approximately
    $33.0 million in 2008 for its pension and other benefit
    plans.

 

    Rowan has cash bonus and profit sharing plans covering
    approximately 400 employees. At December 31, 2007, the
    Company had accrued approximately $11.4 million under such
    plans, most of which it expects to pay to eligible employees in
    2008. At December 31, 2006, the Company had accrued
    approximately $7.2 million of bonus and profit sharing
    awards, most of which was paid to eligible employees in 2007.

 

    Rowan also sponsors defined contribution plans covering
    substantially all employees. Rowan contributed to the plans
    about $5.2 million in 2007, $4.6 million in 2006, and
    $3.7 million in 2005.

    Management has determined that no valuation allowances were
    necessary at December 31, 2007 and 2006, as anticipated
    future tax benefits relating to all deferred income tax assets
    are expected to be fully realized when measured against a more
    likely than not standard.

 

    Undistributed earnings of Rowans foreign subsidiaries in
    the amount of approximately $34 million could potentially
    be subjected to additional income taxes of approximately
    $9 million. The Company has not provided any deferred
    income taxes on such undistributed foreign earnings because it
    considers such earnings to be permanently invested abroad.

 

    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
    (FIN 48), clarified accounting for income taxes by defining
    the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is

    required to meet before being recognized in the financial
    statements. The Companys adoption of FIN 48 effective
    January 1, 2007, yielded a $1.6 million decrease in
    Retained earnings and a $5.5 million increase in Other
    liabilities as of that date.

 

    At December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007, Rowan had
    $3.4 and $3.6 million, respectively, of net unrecognized
    tax benefits, all of which would reduce the Companys
    income tax provision if recognized. The Company does not expect
    to recognize significant increases or decreases in unrecognized
    tax benefits during the next 12 months.

 

    The following table highlights the changes in the Companys
    has gross unrecognized tax benefits during 2007 (in millions):

    Interest and penalties relating to income taxes are included in
    current income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties at
    January 1, 2007 were $0.2 million and
    $0.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007, both
    amounts were $0.3 million. To the extent accrued interest
    and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions are not
    actually assessed, such accruals will be reversed and the
    reversals will reduce the Companys overall income tax
    provision.

 

    Rowans U.S. federal tax returns for 2001 and
    subsequent years remain subject to examination by tax
    authorities. Various state tax returns for 2003 and subsequent
    years remain open for examination. In the Companys foreign
    tax jurisdictions, returns for 2005 and subsequent years remain
    open for examination. During 2007, The Internal Revenue Service
    closed an examination of a foreign subsidiarys 2004
    U.S. Federal Income Tax Return resulting in no adjustment.
    Rowan is undergoing routine tax examinations in various foreign,
    U.S. federal, state and local taxing jurisdictions in which
    the Company has operated. These examinations cover various tax
    years and are in various stages of finalization. Rowan believes
    that any income taxes ultimately assessed by any foreign,
    U.S. federal, state and local taxing authorities will not
    materially exceed amounts for which the Company has already
    provided.

 

    Income from continuing operations before income taxes consisted
    of $722.4 million, $467.2 million, and
    $326.3 million of domestic earnings, and
    $16.7 million, $26.2 million, and $19.2 million
    of foreign earnings in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

 

    Income tax payments exceeded refunds by $156.9 million in
    2007, $97.7 million in 2006 and $9.2 million in 2005.

 







NOTE 8.  


FAIR
    VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



 

    At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of Rowans
    cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximated
    their fair values due to the short maturity of such financial
    instruments. The carrying amount of the Companys
    floating-rate debt approximated its fair value at
    December 31, 2007 as such instruments bear short-term,
    market-based interest rates. The fair value of Rowans
    fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2007 was estimated to be
    approximately $274 million, or a $9 million premium to
    carrying value, based upon available market information and
    appropriate valuation methods.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES



 

    During 1984 and 1985, Rowan sold two cantilever
    jack-ups,
    the Rowan-Halifax and the Cecil Provine, and
    leased each rig back under operating leases with initial lease
    periods that expired during 2000. At that time, Rowan exercised
    its option to extend each lease for a period of seven and
    one-half years, into 2008, with semi-annual lease payments equal
    to one-half of the weighted average lease payments made during
    the original lease periods.

 

    Rowan has exercised a second renewal option on the Cecil
    Provine operating lease for one additional year through June
    2009. The semi-annual lease payment for that additional year
    will reflect a fair market value charter rate determined through
    a joint appraisal process. The Company believes that the lease
    payment may increase from its current level of $4.9 million
    per year, although the amount is not presently determinable.
    Under the extended lease agreement, the Company retains
    additional lease and purchase options for the Cecil
    Provine.

 

    In September 2005, the Rowan-Halifax was lost during
    Hurricane Rita. The rig was insured for $43.4 million, a
    value the Company believes satisfied the requirements of the
    charter agreement, and by a margin sufficient to cover the
    $6.3 million carrying value of its equipment installed on
    the rig. However, the owner of the rig claimed that the rig
    should have been insured for its fair market value and sought
    recovery from Rowan for compensation above the insured value.
    Thus, the Company assumed no insurance proceeds related to the
    Rowan-Halifax and recorded a charge during 2005 for the
    full carrying value of its equipment. On November 3, 2005,
    the Company filed a declaratory judgment action styled Rowan
    Companies, Inc. vs. Textron Financial Corporation and Wilmington
    Trust Company as Owner Trustee of the Rowan-Halifax 116-C
    Jack-Up Rig
    in the 215th Judicial District Court of Harris County,
    Texas. The owner filed a similar declaratory judgment action,
    claiming a value of approximately $83 million for the rig.
    The owners motion for summary judgment was granted on
    January 25, 2007 which, unless overturned on appeal, would
    make Rowan liable to the owner for the approximately
    $40 million difference between the owners claim and
    the insurance coverage, plus interest and costs. The Company
    continues to believe that its interpretation of the charter
    agreement is correct and is vigorously pursuing an appeal to
    overturn the summary judgment ruling. The Company does not
    believe, therefore, that it is probable that Rowan has incurred
    a loss, nor one that is estimable, and has made no accrual for
    such at December 31, 2007.

 

    The Company has other operating leases covering offices and
    computer equipment. Net rental expense under all operating
    leases was $15.4 million in 2007, $14.2 million in
    2006, and $19.0 million in 2005.

 

    At December 31, 2007, the future minimum payments to be
    made under noncancelable operating leases were as follows (in
    millions):

    Rowan periodically employs letters of credit or other
    bank-issued guarantees in the normal course of its businesses,
    and was contingently liable for performance under such
    agreements to the extent of approximately $38 million at
    December 31, 2007.

 

    During 2005, Rowan lost three additional offshore rigs and
    incurred significant damage on another rig as a result of
    Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Since that time, the Company has
    been working to locate the lost or damaged rigs, salvage related
    equipment, remove debris, wreckage and pollutants from the
    water, mark or clear navigational hazards and clear rights of
    way. At December 31, 2007, Rowan had incurred
    $156.1 million of costs related to such efforts, of which
    $96.6 million had been reimbursed through insurance,
    leaving $59.4 million included in

    Receivables. The Company has since received another
    $35.5 million of insurance reimbursements. The Company
    expects to incur additional costs in the near term to fulfill
    its obligations to remove wreckage and debris in amounts that
    will depend on the extent and nature of work ultimately required
    and the duration thereof. Previously, the Company reported the
    filing of a lawsuit styled Rowan Companies, Inc. vs. Certain
    Underwriters at Lloyds and Insurance Companies Subscribing
    to Cover Note ARS 4183 in the 215th Judicial
    District Court of Harris County, Texas. The lawsuit was
    withdrawn following the agreement by such underwriters to
    reimburse Rowan for the reasonable cost of removing wreckage and
    debris remaining on the drilling locations. Rowan also
    previously reported that certain of its insurance underwriters
    at higher limits of liability had notified the Company that they
    were reserving their right to deny coverage for any costs
    incurred in wreckage and debris removal activities that they
    believed were outside the scope of their policy. This
    reservation of rights letter has now been withdrawn
    and Rowans coverage for costs at these higher limits of
    liability has been reaffirmed. At this time, the Company believe
    that it has adequate insurance coverage and will be reimbursed
    for costs incurred and to be incurred.

 

    Rowan has ongoing environmental responsibilities related
    primarily to its manufacturing operations and facilities. During
    2006, the Company recorded a $7.8 million charge for the
    costs incurred to collect and dispose of a radioactive material
    that was released while processing scrap at its Longview, Texas
    steel mill. The measurement of remediation costs is subject to
    uncertainties, including the evolving nature of environmental
    regulations and the extent of any agreements to mitigate
    remediation costs.

 

    During 2004, Rowan learned that the Environmental and Natural
    Resources Division, Environmental Crimes Section of the
    U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had begun conducting a
    criminal investigation of environmental matters involving
    several of the Companys offshore drilling rigs, including
    a rig known as the Rowan-Midland, which at various times
    operated at locations in the Gulf of Mexico. As part of an
    amended Plea agreement entered into with the DOJ on
    November 8, 2007, under which Rowan pled guilty to three
    felony charges relating to operations on the Rowan-Midland
    between 2002 and 2004, the Company paid a fine of
    $7 million and made community service payments totaling
    $2 million to various organizations. In anticipation of
    such payments, the Company recognized a $9 million charge
    to its fourth quarter 2006 operations. Under the amended Plea
    agreement, Rowan is subject to unsupervised probation for a
    period of three years, during which time the Company must ensure
    that it commits no further criminal violations of federal,
    state, or local laws or regulations and must also continue to
    implement its comprehensive Environmental Management System
    Plan. Subsequent to the conduct at issue, the Company sold the
    Rowan-Midland to a third party.

 

    The Environmental Protection Agency has approved a compliance
    agreement with Rowan which, among other things, contains a
    certification that the conditions giving rise to the violations
    to which the Company entered guilty pleas have been corrected.
    If Rowan fully complies with the terms of the compliance
    agreement, the Company believes that it will not be suspended or
    debarred from entering into or participating in contracts with
    the U.S. Government or any of its agencies.

 

    On January 3, 2008, a civil lawsuit styled State of
    Louisiana, ex. rel. Charles C. Foti, Jr. , Attorney General
    vs. Rowan Companies, Inc. was filed in the Eastern District
    Court of Texas, Marshall Division, seeking damages, civil
    penalties and costs and expenses for alleged commission of
    maritime torts and violations of environmental and other laws
    and regulations involving the Rowan-Midland and other
    facilities in areas in or near Louisiana. The Company intends to
    vigorously defend its position in this case but cannot estimate
    any potential liability at this time.

 

    During 2005, the Company learned that the DOJ was conducting an
    investigation of potential antitrust violations among helicopter
    transportation providers in the Gulf of Mexico. Rowans
    former aviation subsidiary, which was sold effective
    December 31, 2004, received a subpoena in connection with
    the investigation. The Company has not been contacted by the
    DOJ, but the purchaser claimed that Rowan is responsible for any
    exposure it may have. The Company has disputed that claim.

 

    In June 2007, Rowan received a subpoena for documents from the
    U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana
    relating to a grand jury hearing. The agency requesting the
    information is the U.S. Department of the



    71

    Interior, Office of Inspector General Investigations. The
    documents requested include all records relating to use of the
    Companys entertainment facilities and entertainment
    expenses for a former employee of the Minerals Management
    Service, U.S. Department of Interior and other records
    relating to items of value provided to any official or employee
    of the U.S. Government. The Company fully cooperated with
    the subpoena and has received no further requests.

 

    The construction of Rowans fourth Tarzan Class
    jack-up
    rig, the J. P. Bussell, was originally subcontracted to
    an outside Gulf of Mexico shipyard, Signal International LLC
    (Signal), and scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of
    2007 at a total cost of approximately $145 million. As a
    result of various problems encountered on the project, the
    expected completion of the rig is now at least one year behind
    schedule and its expected final cost is at least 20% over the
    original estimate. Accordingly, Rowan has recently declared
    Signal in breach of contract and initiated court proceedings
    styled Rowan Companies, Inc. and LeTourneau Technologies,
    Inc. vs. Signal International LLC in the
    269th Judicial
    District Court of Harris County, Texas to relocate the rig to
    the Companys Sabine Pass, Texas facility for completion by
    its Drilling Products and Systems segment and to recover the
    cost to complete the rig over and above the agreed contract
    price, plus interest. It is anticipated that Signal will file a
    counterclaim against Rowan, alleging breach of contract and
    claiming damages for amounts owed and additional costs incurred
    totaling in excess of $20 million. The Company intends to
    vigorously defend its rights under the contract. The Company
    does not believe that it is probable that Rowan has incurred a
    loss, nor one that is estimable, and has made no accrual for
    such at December 31, 2007.

 

    Rowan is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental
    to its businesses and is vigorously defending its position in
    all such matters. The Company believes that there are no other
    known contingencies, claims or lawsuits that could have a
    material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

 







NOTE 10.  


SEGMENTS
    OF BUSINESS



 

    Rowan has three principal operating segments: the contract
    drilling of oil and gas wells, both onshore and offshore
    (Drilling), and two manufacturing segments. The
    Drilling Products and Systems segment provides equipment, parts
    and services for the drilling industry including
    jack-up
    rigs, rig kits and related components and parts, mud pumps,
    drawworks, top drives, rotary tables, other rig equipment,
    variable-speed motors, drives and other electrical components
    featuring AC, DC and Switch Reluctance technologies. The Mining,
    Forestry and Steel Products segment includes large-wheeled
    mining and timber equipment and related parts and carbon and
    alloy steel and steel plate.

 

    Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 131, Rowans reportable segments reflect an
    aggregation of separately managed, strategic business units for
    which financial information is separately prepared and monitored
    based upon qualitative and quantitative factors. The Company
    evaluates segment performance based upon income from operations.
    In the prior year, the Company reported one manufacturing
    segment and that information has been adjusted to conform to the
    current year presentation. The accounting policies of each
    segment are as described in Rowans summary of significant
    accounting policies within Note 1. The following tables
    exclude information pertaining to Rowans boat operations,
    which were sold in 2005. See Note 12 for more information
    regarding the Companys discontinued operations.

 

    Drilling services are provided in domestic and foreign areas,
    and Rowan classifies its drilling rigs as domestic or foreign
    based upon the rigs operating location. Accordingly,
    drilling rigs operating in or offshore the United States
    are considered domestic assets and rigs operating in other areas
    are deemed foreign assets. At December 31, 2007, nine
    offshore rigs and 29 land rigs were located in domestic
    areas and 12 offshore rigs were located in foreign areas.
    Manufacturing operations are primarily conducted in Longview and
    Houston, Texas and Vicksburg, Mississippi, though products are
    shipped throughout the United States and to many foreign
    locations.

    During 2007, one customer, Saudi Aramco, accounted for 13% of
    the Companys consolidated revenues. During 2006 and 2005,
    no customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues.

 

    Rowan believes that it has no significant concentrations of
    credit risk. The Company has never experienced any significant
    credit losses and its drilling segment customers have heretofore
    primarily been large energy companies and government bodies.
    Rowans manufacturing operations help diversify the
    Companys operations and attendant credit risk. Further,
    Rowan retains the ability to relocate its major drilling assets
    over significant distances on a timely basis in response to
    changing market conditions.

NOTE 11.  


RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS



 

    A Rowan director serves as Of Counsel for a law firm that
    represents Rowan on certain matters and to which the Company
    paid approximately $279,000, $143,000 and $923,000 for legal
    fees and expenses in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Rowan
    believes that the fees reflected market rates and the services
    were approved by the Companys Board of Directors.

 







NOTE 12.  


DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS



 

    In February 2005, Rowan sold the purchase options it held on
    four leased anchor-handling boats for approximately
    $21 million in cash which resulted in a gain of
    $13.1 million (net of a provision for income taxes of
    $7.6 million). The leases covering the Companys two
    remaining boats expired during the second quarter of 2005, when
    they were returned to the lessor and Rowan exited the marine
    vessel business.

 

    On December 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its
    aviation operations, for approximately $118.1 million in
    cash, before selling expenses and subject to post-closing
    working capital adjustments, which resulted in a loss of
    $16.0 million (net of a credit for income taxes of
    $8.4 million). During 2005, the Company recorded an
    incremental loss on the sale of $1.9 million (net of a
    related tax benefit of $1.1 million) which resulted from
    post-closing working capital adjustments pursuant to the sale
    agreement. During 2006, the Company received a refund of excise
    taxes related to its aviation operations that were paid under
    protest in 2004.

ASSET
    DISPOSITIONS



 

    During 2005, Rowan received approximately $109 million in
    connection with the sale or hurricane-related loss of various
    offshore drilling rigs. In September of that year, the Company
    sold one of its oldest
    jack-up
    rigs, the Rowan-Texas, for approximately $45 million
    in cash, after selling expenses. During the fourth quarter, the
    Company received approximately $51 million in insurance
    proceeds related to the loss of its
    jack-up
    drilling rigs Rowan-New Orleans, Rowan-Odessa and
    Rowan-Fort Worth during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

 

    In October 2005, Rowan agreed to sell its only semi-submersible
    rig, the Rowan-Midland, for approximately
    $60 million in cash. Payment for the rig occurred over a
    15-month
    period ending in January 2007, at which point the title to the
    rig was transferred to the buyer. The Company retained ownership
    of much of the drilling equipment on the rig, which was sold in
    2006 and 2007, and continued to provide (through February
    2007) a number of operating personnel under a separate
    services agreement. The transaction was accounted for as a
    sales-type lease with the expected gain on the sale and imputed
    interest income of approximately $46 million deferred until
    the net book value of the rig had been recovered. During 2007,
    the Company received all remaining payments totaling
    $23.4 million and recognized such amount as additional gain
    on the sale.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


 

    To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of


    Rowan Companies, Inc.


    Houston, Texas

 

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Rowan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company)
    as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,
    changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007.
    These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

 

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

 

    In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America.

 

    We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 27, 2008 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control
    over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL
    OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING


PURSUANT TO SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF
    2002

 

    The management of Rowan is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    for the Company as defined in
    Rules 13a-15(f)
    and
    15d-15(f) of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal
    controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the
    reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation and
    presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or
    disposition.

 

    Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are
    required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls
    relative to a suitable framework. The Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) developed a
    formalized, organization-wide framework that embodies five
    interrelated components  the control environment,
    risk assessment, control activities, information and
    communication and monitoring, as they relate to three internal
    control objectives  operating effectiveness and
    efficiency, financial reporting reliability and compliance with
    laws and regulations.

 

    Our assessment included an evaluation of the design of our
    internal control over financial reporting relative to COSO and
    testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control
    over financial reporting. Based upon our assessment, we have
    concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting
    were effective as of December 31, 2007.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


 

    To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of


    Rowan Companies, Inc.


    Houston, Texas

 

    We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Rowan Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company)
    as of December 31, 2007 based on criteria established in
    Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Companys management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Companys internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

 

    We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 

    A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    companys principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the companys board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    companys assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

 

    Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

 

    In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

 

    We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated
    February 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our

Table of ContentsMIRANT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005 1.    Description of Business and Organization Mirant is a competitive energy company that produces and sells electricity in the United States. The Company owns or leases 10,280 MW of electric
generating capacity located in markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions and in California. Mirant also operates an integrated asset management and energy marketing organization based in Atlanta, Georgia. Mirant Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on September 23, 2005. Pursuant to the Plan for Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries, on
January 3, 2006, New Mirant emerged from bankruptcy and acquired substantially all of the assets of Old Mirant, a corporation that was formed in Delaware on April 3, 1993, and that had been named Mirant Corporation prior to January 3,
2006. The Plan provides that New Mirant has no successor liability for any unassumed obligations of Old Mirant. Old Mirant was then renamed and transferred to a trust, which is not affiliated with New Mirant. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company commenced separate auction processes to sell its Philippine (2,203 MW) and Caribbean (1,050 MW) businesses and
six U.S. natural gas-fired facilities totaling 3,619 MW, consisting of the Zeeland (903 MW), West Georgia (613 MW), Shady Hills (469 MW), Sugar Creek (561 MW), Bosque (546 MW) and Apex (527 MW) facilities. On May 1, 2007, the Company completed
the sale of the six U.S. natural gas-fired facilities. On June 22, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its Philippine business. On August 8, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its Caribbean business. In addition, on May 7,
2007, the Company completed the sale of Mirant NY-Gen (121 MW). After transaction costs and repayment of debt, the net proceeds to Mirant from dispositions completed in the year ended December 31, 2007, were approximately $5.071 billion.
See Note 11 for additional information regarding the accounting for these businesses and facilities as discontinued operations. On
April 9, 2007, Mirant announced that its Board of Directors had decided to explore strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. In the exploration process, the Board of Directors considered whether the interests of stockholders would be
best served by returning excess cash from the sale proceeds to stockholders, with the Company continuing to operate its retained businesses or, alternatively, whether greater stockholder value would be achieved by entering into a transaction with
another company, including a sale of the Company in its entirety. On November 9, 2007, Mirant announced the conclusion of the strategic review process. The Company plans to return a total of $4.6 billion of excess cash to its stockholders.
The first stage of the cash distribution is being accomplished through an accelerated share repurchase program for $1 billion, plus open market purchases for up to an additional $1 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2007, in conjunction
with the accelerated share repurchases, the Company repurchased approximately 26.66 million shares of common stock for $1 billion. See Note 13 for further discussion. In addition, Mirant purchased approximately 8.27 million shares of its
common stock for approximately $316 million through open market purchases. Between January 1, 2008 and February 25, 2008, the Company purchased an additional 7.9 million shares in open market purchases for approximately $286 million.
On February 29, 2008, the Company announced that it had decided to return the remaining $2.6 billion of cash through open market purchases of common stock but that it would continue to evaluate the most efficient method to return the cash to
stockholders.  F-7 
Table of Contents2.    Accounting and Reporting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying
consolidated financial statements of Mirant and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The accompanying
financial statements include the accounts of Mirant and its wholly-owned and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries as well as VIEs in which Mirant has an interest and is the primary beneficiary. The financial statements have been prepared from
records maintained by Mirant and its subsidiaries in their respective countries of operation. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As of December 31, 2007, all of Mirants
subsidiaries are wholly-owned. The Companys obligations to MC Asset Recovery result in its treatment as a variable interest entity in which Mirant is the primary beneficiary as defined in FIN 46R. The entity, therefore, is included in the
Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 18 for further discussion of MC Asset Recovery. In preparing the Companys
2006 federal income tax return during 2007, the Company discovered a misstatement in the historical tax basis of its Philippine business. The sale of the Philippine business was completed on June 22, 2007. The result of the misstatement was an
overstatement of the benefit for income taxes as a component of continuing operations and an equivalent understatement of income from discontinued operations by approximately $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Basic and diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations were overstated by $0.10 and $0.09, respectively. Conversely, basic and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were understated by the same amounts. The misstatement had no effect on net
income or stockholders equity. The consolidated statement of operations and related footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2006, have been adjusted to reflect the immaterial correction of this misstatement. In conjunction with Mirants tax planning associated with the utilization of NOLs, the Company reevaluated certain items included in its historical
tax basis balance sheets used in the calculation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities. As a result of this reevaluation, the values of certain components of Mirants inventory of deferred tax assets and liabilities have
been adjusted. Current deferred income tax assets were increased by $134 million and noncurrent deferred income tax assets were decreased by $174 million at December 31, 2006. Current deferred income tax liabilities were increased by $40
million at December 31, 2006. The adjustments had no effect on the net deferred taxes on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the adjustments had no effect on net income, earnings per share or stockholders equity.
The consolidated balance sheet and the income tax disclosures in Note 7 reflect the immaterial correction of this misstatement. In
preparing the Companys 2007 consolidated statement of cash flow, the Company discovered that capitalized interest expense for projects under construction had been included in cash flows from operating activities, rather than cash flows from
investing activities in 2006. The result of the misstatement was an understatement of cash provided by operating activities and an understatement of cash used in investing activities of approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31,
2006. The misstatement had no effect on cash, net income, or stockholders equity. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006, has been adjusted to reflect the immaterial correction of this misstatement.
All amounts are presented in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. In accordance with SFAS 144, the results of operations of the
Companys businesses and facilities that have been disposed of and have met the criteria for such classification, have been reclassified to discontinued operations and the associated assets and liabilities have been reclassified to assets and
liabilities held for sale for all periods presented. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year financial statement presentation.

Table of ContentsUse of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Mirants significant estimates
include:  

 

 
 determining the fair value of certain derivative contracts;  

 

 
 estimating future taxable income in determining its deferred tax asset valuation allowance;  

 

 
 estimating the useful lives of our long-lived assets;  

 

 
 determining the value of Mirants asset retirement obligations;  

 

 
 estimating future cash flows in determining impairments of long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets;  

 

 
 estimating the expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases and other actuarial assumptions used in estimating pension and other postretirement
benefit plan liabilities;  

 

 
 estimating losses to be recorded for contingent liabilities; and  

 

 
 estimating certain assumptions used in the grant date fair value of stock options. Revenue Recognition Mirant recognizes revenue from the sale of energy when earned and
collection is probable. Some sales of energy are based on economic dispatch, or as-ordered by an ISO, based on member participation agreements, but without an underlying contractual commitment. ISO revenues and revenues from sales of
energy based on economic-dispatch are recorded on the basis of MWh delivered, at the relevant day-ahead or real-time prices. When a long-term electric power agreement conveys to the buyer of the electric power the right to use the generating
capacity of Mirants facility, that agreement is evaluated to determine if it is a lease of the generating facility rather than a sale of electric power. Operating lease revenue for the Companys generating facilities is normally recorded
as capacity revenue and included in operating revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or
liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings, unless the Company elects to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting based on meeting specific criteria in SFAS 133. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that it had designated as fair value or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Mirants derivative financial instruments are categorized by the Company based on the business
objective the instrument is expected to achieve: asset management or proprietary trading. All derivative contracts are recorded at fair value, except for a limited number of transactions that qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales
exclusion from SFAS 133 and therefore qualify for the use of accrual accounting. As the Companys commodity derivative financial
instruments have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes, changes in such instruments fair values are recognized currently in earnings. For asset management activities, changes in fair value of electricity derivative financial
instruments are reflected in operating revenue and changes in fair value of fuel derivative contracts are reflected in cost of fuel, electricity and other products in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value
and settlements of contracts for proprietary trading activities are recorded on a net basis as operating revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Table of ContentsConcentration of Revenues In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Mirant earned a significant portion of its operating revenue and gross margin from the PJM energy market, where its Mirant Mid-Atlantic generating facilities are located. Mirant
Mid-Atlantics revenues and gross margin as a percentage of Mirants total revenues and gross margin from continuing operations are as follows:

Concentration of Labor Subject to Collective Bargaining Agreements At December 31, 2007, approximately 48% of Mirants employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which 60% are subject to the
collective bargaining agreement in the Mid-Atlantic region. Cash and Cash Equivalents Mirant considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2007, except
for amounts held in bank accounts to cover current payables, all of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were invested in AAA-rated U.S. Treasury money market funds. Restricted Cash Restricted cash is included in current and noncurrent assets as funds on
deposit and other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2007, current and noncurrent funds on deposit were $304 million and $7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, current and
noncurrent funds on deposit were $235 million and $6 million, respectively. Restricted cash includes deposits with brokers and cash collateral posted with third parties to support the Companys commodity positions as well as a $200 million
deposit by Mirant North America posted under its senior secured term loan to support the issuance of letters of credit. Inventory
Inventory consists primarily of oil, coal, purchased emissions allowances and materials and supplies. Inventory, including
commodity trading inventory, is generally stated at the lower of cost or market value. Fuel stock is removed from the inventory account as it is used in the production of electricity. Materials and supplies are removed from the inventory account
when they are used for repairs, maintenance or capital projects. Purchased emissions allowances are recorded in inventory at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is computed on an average cost basis. Purchased emissions allowances for SO2 and NOx are removed from inventory and charged to cost of fuel, electricity and other products in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations as they are utilized against emissions volumes that exceed the allowances granted to the Company by the EPA. Inventory at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, consisted of (in millions):

Table of ContentsGranted Emissions Allowances Included in property, plant and equipment are emissions allowances granted by the EPA that were projected to be required to offset physical emissions related to generating facilities owned by the Company. These
emissions allowances were recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition of the facility and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective generating facility and are charged to depreciation and
amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Included in other intangible assets are:
(1) emissions allowances granted by the EPA related to generating facilities owned by the Company that are projected to be in excess of those required to offset physical emissions; and (2) emissions allowances related to generating
facilities leased by the Company. Emissions allowances related to leased generating facilities are recorded at fair value at the commencement of the lease. These emissions allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period up to 30
years for emissions allowances related to owned generating facilities or the term of the lease for emissions allowances related to leased generating facilities, and are charged to depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the capital expenditures Mirant is making to comply with the requirements of the
Maryland Healthy Air Act, the Company anticipates that it will have significant excess emissions allowances in future periods. The Company plans to continue to maintain some emissions allowances in excess of expected generation in case its actual
generation exceeds its current forecasts for future periods and for possible future additions of generating capacity. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company began a program to sell excess emissions allowances dependent upon market
conditions. The Company sold approximately $24 million of excess emissions allowances and recognized a gain of $22 million, which is included in gain on sales of assets in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2007. The Company has determined that certain exchanges of emissions allowances that the Company may periodically transact qualify as nonmonetary exchanges under SFAS 153. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, which
includes materials, labor, and associated payroll-related and overhead costs and the cost of financing construction. The cost of routine maintenance and repairs, such as inspections and corrosion removal, and the replacement of minor items of
property are charged to expense as incurred. Certain expenditures incurred during a major maintenance outage of a generating facility are capitalized, including the replacement of major component parts and labor and overhead incurred to install the
parts. Depreciation of the recorded cost of depreciable property, plant and equipment is determined using primarily composite rates. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the expected life of the related equipment or the lease
term. Upon the retirement or sale of property, plant and equipment the cost of such assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets. No gain or loss is recognized for ordinary retirements in the
normal course of business since the composite depreciation rates used by Mirant take into account the effect of interim retirements.  F-11 
Table of ContentsCapitalization of Interest Cost Mirant capitalizes interest on projects during their construction period. The Company determines which debt instruments represent a reasonable measure of
the cost of financing construction assets in terms of interest cost incurred that otherwise could have been avoided. These debt instruments and associated interest costs are included in the calculation of the weighted average interest rate used for
determining the capitalization rate. Once placed in service, capitalized interest, as a component of the total cost of the plant, is amortized over the estimated useful life of the plant. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
the Company incurred the following interest costs (in millions):

In the third quarter of 2005, the Company determined that it was probable that contractual
interest on liabilities subject to compromise from the Petition Date would be incurred for certain claims expected to be allowed under the Plan and, accordingly, recorded approximately $1.4 billion of interest expense in 2005 on liabilities
subject to compromise. Operating Leases Mirant leases various assets under non-cancelable leasing arrangements, including generating facilities, office space and other equipment. The rental expense associated with leases that qualify as operating
leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term within operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The Companys most significant operating leases are Mirant Mid-Atlantics
leases of the Morgantown and Dickerson baseload units, which expire in 2034 and 2029, respectively. Mirant has an option to extend these leases. Any extensions of the respective leases would be limited to 75% of the economic useful life of the
facility, as measured from the beginning of the original lease term through the end of the proposed remaining lease term. As of December 31, 2007, the total notional minimum lease payments for the remaining terms of the leases of the
Morgantown and Dickerson baseload units aggregated approximately $2.1 billion. Curtailment of Other Postretirement Benefits During the fourth quarter of 2006, Mirant amended its postretirement benefit plan covering non-union employees to eliminate all employer-provided
subsidies through a gradual phase-out by 2011. This action occurred after the Companys September 30 annual measurement date for actuarial purposes used for measuring its December 31, 2006, obligation. The Company recognized a
curtailment gain of approximately $32 million in the first quarter of 2007. This gain is included as a reduction of operations and maintenance expense on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Intangible Assets Intangible
assets with definite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives ranging up to 40 years to their estimated residual values. Investments For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company completed the
sales of investments described below. The related gains are recorded in gain on sales of investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.  F-12 
Table of ContentsEquity Investment in InterContinental Exchange.    In 2005, the Company sold a
portion of its investment in InterContinental Exchange for $48 million and realized a gain of $44 million. In 2006, the Company sold its remaining investment in InterContinental Exchange for $58 million and realized a gain of $54 million.
New York Mercantile Exchange Seats.    In late 1998 and early 1999, the Company acquired two seats on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. In 2006, the Company sold its investment for $20 million and recognized a gain of $19 million, which is recorded in gain on sales of investments, net on the Companys consolidated statement of operations.
Environmental Remediation Costs Mirant accrues for costs associated with environmental remediation when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than
completion of the remediation feasibility study. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. The cost of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value.
Debt Issuance Costs Debt
issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest expense on a basis that approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. SFAS 109 requires that a
valuation allowance be established when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. In making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets, including the Companys past and
anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Objective
positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists. It is the Companys view that future sources of taxable
income, reversing temporary differences and implemented tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance has been established. A portion of the Companys NOLs (approximately $341
million) is attributable to excess tax deductions primarily related to bankruptcy transactions. The recognition of the tax benefit of these excess tax deductions, either through realization or reduction of the valuation allowance, will be an
increase to additional paid-in-capital in stockholders equity. These NOLs will be the last utilized for financial reporting purposes. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Mirant evaluates long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and
purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Such evaluations are performed in accordance with SFAS 144.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an 
 F-13 
Table of Contents
asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are not depreciated. The assets and
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles The Company adopted FIN 47,
effective December 31, 2005, related to the costs associated with conditional legal obligations to retire tangible, long-lived assets. Conditional asset retirement obligations are recorded at the fair value in the period in which they are
incurred by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. In each subsequent period, the liability is accreted to its fair value and the capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. For the year
ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a charge as a cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle of approximately $15 million, net of tax, related to the adoption of this accounting standard. Earnings per Share Earnings per share
information for 2005 has not been presented. The Company does not think that this information is relevant in any material respect for users of its financial statements. See Note 14 for further discussion. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential common shares, including common shares from warrants, restricted stock shares, restricted stock units and
stock options using the treasury stock method. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 155, which allows fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded
derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a re-measurement event beginning in the first fiscal year after September 15, 2006. At the date of
adoption, any difference between the total carrying amount of the existing bifurcated hybrid financial instrument and the fair value of the combined hybrid financial instrument will be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning
retained earnings. The Company adopted SFAS 155 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 155 did not affect the Companys statements of operations, financial position or cash flows. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 156, which requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be measured
initially at fair value and permits, but does not require, an entity to measure subsequently those servicing assets or liabilities at fair value. The Company adopted SFAS 156 on January 1, 2007. All requirements for recognition and initial
measurement of servicing assets and servicing liabilities have been applied prospectively to transactions occurring after the adoption of this statement. The adoption of SFAS 156 did not have a material effect on the Companys statements of
operations, financial position or cash flows. On June 28, 2006, the FASB ratified the EITFs consensus reached on EITF 06-3,
which relates to the income statement presentation of taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities. The Task Force affirmed as a consensus on this issue that the presentation of taxes on either a gross basis or a net basis
within the scope of EITF 06-3 is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to APB 22. A company should disclose the amount of those taxes that is recognized on a gross basis in interim and annual financial statements for each
period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are 
 F-14 
Table of Contents
significant. The Company adopted EITF 06-3 on January 1, 2007. While the amounts are not material, the Companys policy is to present such taxes on
a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations. On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. Only tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date were recognized or
continue to be recognized. The total effect of adopting FIN 48 was an increase in stockholders equity of $117 million. See Note 7 for additional information on FIN 48. On May 2, 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN 48-1, which amended FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax
position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. In determining whether a tax position is effectively settled, companies are required to make the assessment on a position-by-position basis;
however, a company could conclude that all positions in a particular tax year are effectively settled. The Companys initial adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, was consistent with the provisions of FSP FIN 48-1. New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted On September 29, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, which includes the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement. This requirement is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company currently uses a September 30 measurement date each year and will transition to a fiscal year-end measurement date by December 31, 2008. This transition will result in a direct
adjustment to retained earnings during 2008 that represents one quarter of the annual net periodic benefit cost. On September 15,
2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according
to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., levels 1, 2 and 3 as defined). Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding fair value measurements in the level 3 category, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending
balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value. Mirant adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008, for financial instruments and nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The FASB deferred the effective date to January 1, 2009, for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a
recurring basis. SFAS 157 nullifies a portion of the guidance in EITF 02-3. Under EITF 02-3, the transaction price presumption prohibited
recognition of a day one gain or loss at the inception of a derivative contract unless the fair value of that derivative was substantially based on quoted prices or a valuation process incorporating observable inputs. Day one gains or losses on
transactions that had been deferred under EITF 02-3 were recognized in the period that valuation inputs became observable or when the contract performed.In addition, SFAS 157 also clarifies that an issuers credit standing should be considered when measuring liabilities at fair value, precludes the use of a block discount when measuring instruments traded in an
actively quoted market at fair value and requires costs relating to acquiring instruments carried at fair value to be recognized as expense when incurred. SFAS 157 requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best available information. SFAS 157 clarified that fair value should be measured
at the exit price, which is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability. The exit price may or may not equal the transaction price and the exit price objective applies regardless of a companys intent or ability to sell the asset or
transfer the liability at the measurement date. The

Company currently measures fair value using the approximate mid-point of the bid and ask prices. Upon adoption of SFAS 157, the Company will measure fair
value based on the bid or ask price for its price risk management assets and liabilities in accordance with the exit price objective. The
provisions of SFAS 157 are to be applied prospectively, except for the initial effect on three specific items: (1) changes in fair value measurements of existing derivative financial instruments measured initially using the transaction price
presumption under EITF 02-3, (2) existing hybrid financial instruments measured initially at fair value using the transaction price, and (3) blockage factor discounts. Adjustments to these items required under SFAS 157 are to be recorded
as a transition adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a gain of
approximately $1 million as a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit, net of income tax on January 1, 2008. The cumulative-effect adjustment relates entirely to the recognition of inception gains and losses formerly deferred under
EITF 02-3. On February 15, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, which permits an entity to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value by electing a fair value option. Once elected, the fair value option may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is irrevocable and is applied only to entire instruments. SFAS 159 also requires companies with
trading and available-for-sale securities to report the unrealized gains and losses for which the fair value option has been elected within earnings for the period presented. SFAS 159 is effective at the beginning of the first fiscal year after
November 15, 2007. The Company adopted SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material effect on the Companys statements of operations, financial position or cash flows as the Company did not elect the
fair value option for any of its financial instruments. On April 30, 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN 39-1, which amended
FIN 39, to indicate that the following fair value amounts could be offset against each other if certain conditions of FIN 39 are otherwise met: (a) those recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a
master netting arrangement and (b) those recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from the same master netting arrangement as the derivative instruments.
In addition, a reporting entity is not precluded from offsetting the derivative instruments if it determines that the amount recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral is not a fair value amount. FSP FIN 39-1 is effective at the
beginning of the first fiscal year after November 15, 2007. The adoption of FSP FIN 39-1 requires retrospective application for all financial statements presented as a change in accounting principle. The Company adopted FSP FIN 39-1
on January 1, 2008, and elected to continue to net the price risk management assets and liabilities subject to master netting agreements. The Company will reflect the adoption of FSP FIN 39-1 in its consolidated financial position at
March 31, 2008, and reclassify amounts at December 31, 2007, to be consistent with the March 31, 2008, presentation. The adoption of FSP FIN 39-1 has no effect on the Companys consolidated statements of operations or cash
flows. On December 21, 2007, the SEC issued SAB 110, which amends SAB 107 to allow for the continued use of the simplified method to
estimate the expected term in valuing stock options beyond December 31, 2007. The simplified method can only be applied to certain types of stock options for which sufficient exercise history is not available. The Company adopted SAB 110 on
January 1, 2008, and will continue to use the simplified method until sufficient exercise history is available.  F-16

Financial Instruments Commodity Financial Instruments
The Company manages the risks around fuel supply and power to be generated from its physical asset positions. Mirant manages the
price risk associated with asset management activities through a variety of methods. Mirants Risk Management Policy requires that asset management activities are restricted to only those activities that are risk-reducing in nature. In
addition, the Company, through its proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities, attempts to achieve incremental returns by entering into energy contracts where it has specific market expertise or physical asset positions. Proprietary
trading and fuel oil management activities increase risk and expose the Company to risk of loss if prices move differently than expected. Mirant enters into a variety of derivative financial and physical instruments to manage its exposure to the prices of the fuel it acquires for generating electricity, as well as the electricity that it sells. These include contractual
agreements, such as forward purchase and sale agreements, futures, swaps and option contracts. Futures are traded on national exchanges and swaps are typically traded in OTC financial markets. Option contracts are traded on both a national exchange
and in OTC financial markets. These contractual agreements have varying terms, notional amounts and durations, or tenors, which range from a few days to a number of years, depending on the instrument. As part of its proprietary trading activities,
the Company is exposed to certain market risks in an effort to generate gains from changes in market prices by entering into derivative instruments, including exchange-traded and OTC contracts, as well as other contractual arrangements. Derivative instruments are recorded at their estimated fair value in the Companys accompanying consolidated balance sheets as price risk
management assets and liabilities except for a limited number of transactions that qualify for the normal purchase or normal sale exception election that allows accrual accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value and settlements of electricity
derivative financial instruments are reflected in operating revenue and changes in the fair value and settlements of fuel derivative contracts are reflected in cost of fuel and other products in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company does not have any derivative instruments for which hedge accounting has been elected.  F-17

The Settlement Agreement and Release (the Settlement Agreement) with Pepco and various
affiliates of Pepco (collectively the Pepco Settling Parties) dated May 30, 2006, became fully effective August 10, 2007, and, as a result, the contractual agreement with Pepco with respect to certain PPAs (the
Back-to-Back Agreement) was rejected and terminated. As a result, the Company had no price risk management liabilities related to the Back-to-Back Agreement at December 31, 2007. The fair value of the price risk management liability
related to the Back-to-Back Agreement was reversed and the Company recognized a gain of $341 million in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. See Pepco Litigation in Note 19 for further discussion of
the Settlement Agreement.  F-18

The volumetric weighted average maturity, or weighted average tenor, of the price risk management
portfolio at December 31, 2007, was approximately 12 months. The net notional amount, or net short position, of the price risk management assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007, was approximately 26 million equivalent MWh.
Fair Values Financial
instruments recorded at market or fair value include cash and interest-bearing cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and financial instruments used for price risk management purposes. The following methods are used by Mirant to estimate
the fair value of all financial instruments that are not subject to compromise and not otherwise carried at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets: Notes and Other Receivables.    The fair value of Mirants notes receivable are estimated using interest rates it would receive currently for similar types of arrangements.
Long- and Short-Term Debt.    The fair value of Mirants long- and short-term debt is estimated
using quoted market prices, when available. The carrying amounts and fair values of Mirants financial instruments at

Trading rights are intangible assets recognized in connection with asset purchases that represent
the Companys ability to generate additional cash flows by incorporating Mirants trading activities with the acquired generating facilities. Development rights represent the right to expand capacity at certain acquired generating facilities. The existing infrastructure, including storage facilities, transmission interconnections and fuel delivery systems
and contractual rights acquired by Mirant, provide the opportunity to expand or repower certain generating facilities. Emissions
allowances recorded in intangible assets relate to emissions allowances granted for owned generating facilities that were projected at the time of acquisition to be in excess of those required to offset physical emissions and emissions allowances
granted for the leasehold baseload units at the Morgantown and Dickerson facilities. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA that were
projected at the time of acquisition to be required to offset physical emissions for owned assets are recorded within property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense was approximately $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Assuming no future acquisitions,
dispositions or impairments of intangible assets, amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $9 million for each of the next five years.  F-20 
Table of ContentsImpairments on Assets Held and Used In accordance with SFAS 144, an asset classified as held and used shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
An asset impairment charge must be recognized if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long-lived asset is less than the carrying value of that asset. The amount of any impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the
carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is estimated based on the discounted future cash flows from that asset or determined by other valuation techniques. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Background Mirant Lovett has been in ongoing discussions with the NYSDEC and the New York State Office of the Attorney General regarding environmental controls at
the Lovett generating facility in New York. On June 11, 2003, Mirant New York, Mirant Lovett and the State of New York entered into a consent decree (the 2003 Consent Decree). Under the terms of the 2003 Consent Decree, Mirant
Lovett was required to install certain environmental controls on unit 5 of the Lovett facility, convert unit 5 to operate exclusively on natural gas, or discontinue operation of unit 5 by April 30, 2007. The 2003 Consent Decree
also required that certain environmental controls be installed on unit 4 by April 30, 2008, or operation of unit 4 had to be discontinued. On May 10, 2007, Mirant Lovett entered into an amendment to the 2003 Consent Decree with the State of New York that switched the deadlines for shutting down units 4 and 5 so that the deadline for compliance by
unit 5 was extended until April 30, 2008, and the deadline for unit 4 was shortened. Unit 4 discontinued operation as of May 7, 2007. In addition, unit 3 discontinued operation because it was uneconomic for the unit to
continue to run. On May 8, 2007, Mirant New York, Mirant Lovett, Mirant Bowline and Hudson Valley Gas also entered into an agreement
(the Tax Assessments Agreement) with the Town of Stony Point, the Town of Haverstraw and the Village of Haverstraw to set the assessed values for the Lovett and Bowline facilities and the pipeline owned by Hudson Valley Gas for 2007 and
2008 for property tax purposes at the values established for 2006 under a settlement agreement entered into by the Mirant entities and those taxing authorities in December 2006. The Bankruptcy Court approved the amendment to the 2003 Consent Decree and the Tax Assessments Agreement on May 10, 2007. The United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York approved the amendment to the 2003 Consent Decree on May 11, 2007. On October 20,
2007, Mirant Lovett submitted notices of its intent to discontinue operations of unit 5 of the Lovett generating facility as of midnight on April 19, 2008, to the New York Public Service Commission, the NYISO, Orange and Rockland and
several other potentially affected transmission and distribution companies in New York. In its impairment analysis of the Lovett
generating facility in prior periods, the Company assumed multiple scenarios, including the operation of all units of the Lovett facility beyond April 2008. Entering into the amendment to the 2003 Consent Decree and the Tax Assessments
Agreement prompted management to test for recoverability of the Lovett facility under SFAS 144 in the second quarter of 2007. Assumptions and Results
The Companys assessment of Lovett under SFAS 144 in the second quarter of 2007 involved developing two scenarios for the future
expected operation of the Lovett facility. The first scenario considered was the shutdown of unit 5 by April 30, 2008, in accordance with the amendment to the 2003 Consent Decree. The Company also considered a second scenario that assumed
operation of unit 5, utilizing coal as the primary fuel 
 F-21 
Table of Contents
source, through 2012 to allow the Lovett facility to continue to contribute to the reliability of the electric system of the State of New York. Property
taxes under both scenarios were assumed at the assessed levels specified in the Tax Assessments Agreement for those periods. Additionally, both scenarios included an estimated cost for demolition of the facility to reduce future property taxes, a
value for the land on which the facility operates and the sale of previously granted emissions allowances for periods beyond the shutdown date. For purposes of measuring an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets must be grouped at the lowest
level of independent identifiable cash flows. All of the units at Mirant Lovett are viewed as one group. As required under SFAS 144, the assessment did not include the value of new generating capacity that could potentially be constructed at the
current Lovett facility site. As a result of this assessment, in the second quarter of 2007, the Company recorded an impairment loss of
$175 million to reduce the carrying value of the Lovett facility to its estimated fair value. The carrying value of the Lovett facility prior to the impairment was approximately $185 million. The remaining depreciable life for the Lovett
facility was also adjusted to April 30, 2008, based on the high likelihood of a shutdown of unit 5 on that date. Year Ended December 31,
2006 In 2006, the Companys assessment of the Bowline unit 3 suspended construction project resulted in the conclusion that
the Bowline unit 3 project as configured and permitted was not economically viable. As a result of this conclusion, the Company determined the estimated value of the equipment and project termination liabilities. At December 31, 2006, the
carrying value of the development and construction costs for Bowline unit 3 exceeded the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the abandonment of the project. The Company recorded an impairment of $120 million, which is reflected in
impairment losses on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Table of ContentsMirant Americas Generation Senior Notes In 2006, Mirants wholly-owned subsidiary, Mirant Americas Generation, reinstated $1.7 billion of senior notes maturing in 2011, 2021 and 2031.
The reinstated senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of Mirant Americas Generation and are not recourse to any subsidiary or affiliate of Mirant Americas Generation. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company purchased and retired $39
million of Mirant Americas Generation senior notes due in 2011. Mirant North America Senior Secured Credit Facilities Mirant North America, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mirant Americas Generation, entered into senior secured credit facilities in January 2006, which
are comprised of an $800 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a senior secured term loan with an initial principal balance of $700 million amortized to $555 million as of December 31, 2007. At the closing, $200 million
drawn under the senior secured term loan was deposited into a cash collateral account to support the issuance of up to $200 million of letters of credit. At December 31, 2007, there were approximately $199 million of letters of credit
outstanding under the senior secured term loan and approximately $91 million of letters of credit outstanding under the $800 million senior secured revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2007, a total of $710 million was available
under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the senior secured term loan for cash draws or for the issuance of letters of credit. In addition to the quarterly installments of $1.75 million, Mirant North America is required to prepay a portion of the outstanding senior secured term loan principal balance once a year. The prepayment is based on an adjusted EBITDA
calculation that determines excess free cash flows, as defined in the loan agreement. At December 31, 2007, the current estimate of the mandatory principal prepayment of the term loan in the first quarter of 2008 is approximately $132 million.
This amount has been reclassified from long-term debt to current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 2007. The senior secured
credit facilities are senior secured obligations of Mirant North America. In addition, certain subsidiaries of Mirant North America (not including Mirant Mid-Atlantic or Mirant Energy Trading) have jointly and severally guaranteed, as senior secured
obligations, the senior secured credit facilities. The senior secured credit facilities are nonrecourse to any other Mirant entities. Mirant North
America Senior Notes In December 2005, Mirant North America issued senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of
$850 million that bear interest at 7.375% and mature on December 31, 2013. The original senior notes were issued in a private placement and were not registered with the SEC. The proceeds of the original senior notes offering initially were
placed in escrow pending the emergence of Mirant North America from bankruptcy. The proceeds were released from escrow in connection with Mirant North Americas emergence from bankruptcy and the closing of the senior secured credit facilities.
In connection with the issuance of the original senior notes, Mirant North America entered into a registration rights agreement under
which it agreed to complete an exchange offer for the original senior notes. On June 29, 2006, Mirant North America completed its registration under the Securities Act of $850 million of the senior notes and initiated the exchange offer. The
exchange offer was completed on August 4, 2006, with $849.965 million of the outstanding original senior notes being tendered for the senior notes. The terms of the senior notes are identical in all material respects to the terms of the
original senior notes, except that the senior notes are registered under the Securities Act and generally are not subject to transfer restrictions or registration rights. Interest on the notes is payable on each June 30 and December 31. The senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of Mirant North America. In addition, certain subsidiaries of Mirant North America (not
including Mirant Mid-Atlantic or Mirant Energy Trading) have jointly and severally guaranteed, as senior unsecured 
 F-23

obligations, the senior notes. The senior notes are nonrecourse to any other Mirant entities. The notes are redeemable at the option of Mirant North America,
in whole or in part, at any time prior to December 31, 2009, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus a make-whole premium. At any time on or after December 31, 2009, Mirant North America may
redeem the notes at specified redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. At any time prior to December 31, 2008, Mirant North America may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of
the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.375% of the principal amount of the notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. Under the terms of the notes, the
occurrence of a change of control will be a triggering event requiring Mirant North America to offer to purchase all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date of purchase. In addition, certain asset dispositions or casualty events will be triggering events which may require Mirant North America to use the proceeds from those asset dispositions or casualty events to make an offer to purchase the
notes at 100% of their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase if such proceeds are not otherwise used, or committed to be used, within certain time periods, to repay senior secured indebtedness,
to repay indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities (with a corresponding reduction in commitments) or to invest in capital assets related to its business. Debt Maturities At December 31, 2007, the annual scheduled maturities of debt during
the next five years and thereafter were as follows (in millions):

With the exception of 2008, the annual scheduled maturities above do not include estimates of
Mirant North Americas required payments of its senior secured term loan based on its EBITDA. Capital Leases Long-term debt includes a capital lease by Mirant Chalk Point. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the current portion of the long-term debt under this
capital lease was $3 million. The amount outstanding under the capital lease, which matures in 2015, is $30 million with an 8.19% annual interest rate. This lease is of an 84 MW peaking electric power generating facility. Depreciation expense
related to this lease was approximately $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The annual principal payments under this lease are approximately $3 million in 2008 through 2010, $4 million in 2011 through
2012 and $14 million thereafter. The gross amount of assets under the capital lease, recorded in property, plant and equipment, net as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, was $24 million. The related accumulated depreciation was $12 million and
$10 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sources of Funds and Capital Structure The principal sources of liquidity for the Companys future operations and capital expenditures are expected to be: (1) existing cash on hand
and cash flows from the operations of the Companys subsidiaries; (2) letters of credit issued or borrowings made under Mirant North Americas $800 million senior secured revolving credit 
 F-24 
Table of Contents
facility; and (3) $200 million letter of credit capacity available under Mirant North Americas senior secured term loan. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Mirant Americas Generation and Mirant North America, are holding companies and, as a result, the
Company and such subsidiaries are dependent upon dividends, distributions and other payments from their respective subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet their obligations. The ability of certain of the Companys subsidiaries to
pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of their debt or other agreements. In particular, a substantial portion of the cash from the Companys operations is generated by Mirant Mid-Atlantic. The Mirant Mid-Atlantic
leveraged leases contain a number of covenants, including limitations on dividends, distributions and other restricted payments. Under its leveraged leases, Mirant Mid-Atlantic is not permitted to make any dividends, distributions and other
restricted payments unless: (1) it satisfies the fixed charge coverage ratio on a historical basis for the last period of four fiscal quarters; (2) it is projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the next two periods of four
fiscal quarters; and (3) no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. In the event of a default under the leveraged leases or if the restricted payments test is not satisfied, Mirant Mid-Atlantic would not be
able to distribute cash. Based on the Companys calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratios under the leveraged leases as of December 31, 2007, Mirant Mid-Atlantic meets the required 1.7 to 1.0 ratio for restricted payments, both on a
historical and projected basis. Mirant North America is an intermediate holding company that is a subsidiary of Mirant Americas Generation
and the parent of its indirect subsidiaries, including Mirant Mid-Atlantic. Mirant North America incurred certain indebtedness pursuant to its senior notes and senior secured credit facilities secured by the assets of Mirant North America and its
subsidiaries (other than Mirant Mid-Atlantic and Mirant Energy Trading). The indebtedness of Mirant North America includes certain covenants typical in such notes and credit facilities, including restrictions on dividends, distributions and other
restricted payments. Further, the notes and senior secured credit facilities include financial covenants that will exclude from the calculation the financial results of any subsidiary that is unable to make distributions or pay dividends at the time
of such calculation. Thus, the ability of Mirant Mid-Atlantic to make distributions to Mirant North America under the leveraged lease transaction could have a material effect on the calculation of the financial covenants under the senior notes and
senior secured credit facilities of Mirant North America and on its ability to make distributions to Mirant Americas Generation. The
ability of Mirant Americas Generation to pay its obligations is dependent on the receipt of dividends from Mirant North America, capital contributions from Mirant and its ability to refinance all or a portion of those obligations as they become due.
7.    Income Taxes Income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, was $442 million and $1.202 billion, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company had a loss from continuing
operations before taxes of $1.403 billion. The income tax provision (benefit) from continuing operations consisted of the following

Table of ContentsNOLs As required by applicable accounting principles, an enterprise that anticipates the realization of a pre-tax gain must recognize the benefit or detriment of the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the transaction in the year
in which it becomes more likely than not that the gain will be realized. In accordance with EITF 93-17, Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for a Parent Companys Excess Tax Basis in the Stock of a Subsidiary that Is Accounted for as a
Discontinued Operation, the Company recognized a tax benefit in 2006 arising from and related solely to the sale of the Philippine business. Conversely, in 2007, the Company recognized an income tax provision of $721 million that arose from
and was specifically related to the sale of the Philippine business. The entire amount of this provision was recorded in income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007.
At December 31, 2006, Mirant considered it to be more likely than not that it would elect treatment under Internal Revenue Code
Section (§) §382(l)(5). As a result of further tax planning, the Company made the decision to follow §382(l)(6) in its 2006 income tax return that was filed on September 15, 2007. As a result, the recorded deferred
income tax items, including pre-emergence NOLs, are presented in accordance with the §382(l)(6) treatment at December 31, 2007. This change had no net effect on the consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of operations
because the increase in deferred tax asset NOLs was equally offset by an increase in the related deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Under §382(l)(6), the Company is subject to an annual limitation on the use of its NOLs that arose prior to its emergence from bankruptcy on January 3, 2006. The annual limitation is based on a number of factors including the
emergence date value of the Companys stock (as defined for tax purposes), its net unrealized built in gain position on that date, the occurrence or occurrences of realized built in gains in the post emergence years or in future years, and the
effects of subsequent ownership changes (as defined for tax purposes), if any. The NOLs under this election will not be subject to any previous adjustments for interest accrued on debt settled with stock as required under §382(l)(5). The
Company elected in its 2006 tax return to reduce the income tax basis of depreciable assets for any cancellation of debt income that arises from making the §382(l)(6) election. On March 15, 2007, Mirant filed a check-the-box election under which Mirant Asia-Pacific will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes effective January 1, 2007. As a result of this election, Mirant recognized a taxable gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes in 2006, which was fully offset by other deductions and losses arising in that year. The December 31, 2007, federal NOL carryforward for financial reporting was $3.3 billion with expiration dates from 2022 to 2026. The
December 31, 2006, NOL balance under §382(l)(6) was $3.2 billion as adjusted for the effect of the Mirant Asia-Pacific check-the-box election discussed above. Similarly, there is an aggregate amount of $6.5 billion of state NOL
carryforwards with various expiration dates (based on the application of apportionment factors and other state tax limitations). SFAS 109
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. In making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets, including the Companys past
and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Objective
positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists. It is the Companys view that future sources of taxable
income, reversing temporary differences and implemented tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance has been established. The Company continues to maintain its valuation allowance
against its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys deferred tax assets reduced by the valuation allowance are completely offset with its deferred tax liabilities. A portion of the Companys NOLs (approximately $341
million) is attributable to excess tax 
 F-27 
Table of Contents
deductions primarily related to bankruptcy transactions. The recognition of the tax benefit of these excess tax deductions, either through realization or
reduction of the valuation allowance, will be an increase to additional paid-in-capital in stockholders equity. These NOLs will be the last utilized for financial reporting purposes. Tax Uncertainties The Company adopted the
provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. Prior to adoption of FIN 48, Mirant recognized contingent liabilities related to tax uncertainties when it was probable that a loss had occurred and the loss or range of loss could be
reasonably estimated. The recognition of contingent losses for tax uncertainties required management to make significant assumptions about the expected outcomes of certain tax contingencies. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company changed its
method to recognize only liabilities for uncertain tax positions that are less than or subject to the measurement threshold of the more-likely-than-not standard. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, for continuing operations, the
Company recognized a decrease in accrued liabilities of $61 million and an increase of $26 million in taxes receivable. For discontinued operations, the adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a decrease in liabilities held for sale and
accumulated deficit of $30 million. The total effect of adopting FIN 48 was an increase in stockholders equity of $117 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for continuing
operations is as follows (in millions):

The unrecognized tax benefit included the review of tax positions relating to open tax years
beginning in 1999 and continuing to the present. The Companys major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal and multiple state jurisdictions. For U.S. federal income taxes, all tax years prior to 2004 are closed and for state income taxes, the
earliest open year is 1999. However, both the federal and state NOL carryforwards from any closed year is subject to examination until the year that such NOL carryforwards are utilized and that year is closed for audit. The Company does not
anticipate any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. Included in the balance at December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had $4 million and $3 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that would
affect the effective tax rate if it were recognized. The Companys tax provision continues to include an immaterial amount related to the accrual for any penalties and interest subsequent to its adoption of FIN 48. 8.    Employee Benefit Plans Pension
Plans Mirant provides pension benefits to its non-union and union employees through various defined benefit and defined
contribution pension plans. These benefits are based on pay, service history and age at retirement. Defined benefit pensions are not provided for non-union employees hired after April 1, 2000, who participate in a profit sharing arrangement.
Most pension benefits are provided through tax-qualified plans that are funded in accordance with ERISA and Internal Revenue Service requirements. Certain executive pension benefits that cannot be provided by the tax-qualified plans are provided
through unfunded non-tax-qualified plans. The measurement date for the defined benefit plans is September 30 for each year presented. SFAS 158 is designed to improve financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of pension, retiree medical and other postretirement benefit plans on its balance sheets rather than only
disclosing the funded status in the financial statement footnotes. The Company adopted SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, and recognized an increase in other noncurrent liabilities of $21 million related to its underfunded defined benefit pension
plans. Effective December 31, 2008, SFAS 158 also requires that 
 F-28 
Table of Contents
companies measure the funded status of plans as of the year-end balance sheet date. Mirant currently uses September 30 as the date to measure the funded
status of its plans. SFAS 158 offers two transition methods for companies that do not use a year-end measurement date to transition to a December 31, 2008, measurement date. Mirant has elected to use the alternative transition method under SFAS
158 for changing its measurement date, which resulted in an increase to accumulated deficit of $1.8 million as of January 1, 2008. The following table shows the benefit obligations and funded status for the defined benefit pension plans of Mirants continuing operations (in millions):

The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets at year-end 2007 for the
tax qualified pension plans. The total accumulated benefit obligation as of September 30, 2007, was $213 million. The weighted
average assumptions used for measuring year-end pension benefit obligations as of their respective measurement dates are listed in the table below. The discount rate used as of September 30, 2007, was determined based on individual
bond-matching models comprised of portfolios of high quality corporate bonds with projected cash flows and maturity dates reflecting the expected time horizon during which that benefit will be paid. Bonds included in the model portfolios are from a
cross-section of different issuers, are rated AA-rated or better, and are non-callable so that the yield to maturity can actually be attained without intervening calls. For 2006, the discount rate was based on the Moodys Aa Corporate Bond Rate
as of September 30, 2006.

Expected amortization payments.    The estimated net gain (loss) and
prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Additionally, as of
January 1, 2008, Mirant expects to recognize no net gain/(loss) and $0.1 million of prior service cost as other comprehensive income as a result of the adjustment to retained earnings related to the change in measurement date under SFAS 158.
The components of the net periodic benefit cost of Mirants continuing operations pension plans for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, are shown below (in millions):

In determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets, the Company evaluates historic and
current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before determining long-term capital market assumptions. The Company also considers the effects of diversification and portfolio rebalancing. To check for reasonableness and
appropriateness, the Company reviews data about other companies, including their historic returns.  F-30

For the qualified pension plans, Mirant uses a mix of equities and fixed income investments in an
attempt to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The Companys risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial condition. Equity investments
are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks. For U.S. stocks, Mirant employs both a passive and active approach by investing in an index that mirrors the Russell 1000 Index and an actively managed small cap fund. For non-U.S. stocks, Mirant is
invested in an international equity fund that is benchmarked against the Europe, Australia and Far East Index. Fixed income investments include a passive bond market index fund and a long U.S. government/credit index fund which seek to replicate the
Lehman Brothers Long Government/Credit Bond Index. Investment risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly portfolio reviews and annual pension liability measurements. During 2008, Mirant expects to contribute approximately $22 million to the qualified pension plans and approximately $0.3 million to the
non-tax-qualified pension plans. Additionally, Mirant expects the following benefits to be paid from the pension plans (in millions):

Other Postretirement Benefits Mirant also provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees which are accounted for on an accrual basis using an
actuarial method that recognizes the net periodic costs as employees render service to earn the postretirement benefits. The measurement date for these other postretirement benefit plans is September 30 for each year presented. The Company adopted SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, and recognized a decrease in other noncurrent liabilities of $5 million related to its other
postretirement benefit plans. Effective December 31, 2008, SFAS 158 also requires that companies measure the funded status of plans as of the year-end balance sheet date. Mirant currently uses September 30 as the date to measure the funded
status of its plans. SFAS 158 offers two transition methods for companies that do not use a year-end measurement date to transition to a December 31, 2008, measurement date. Mirant has elected to use the alternative transition method under SFAS
158 for changing its measurement date, which has resulted in a decrease to accumulated deficit of $0.2 million as of January 1, 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2006, Mirant amended the postretirement benefit plan covering non-union employees to eliminate all employer provided subsidies through a gradual phase-out by 2011. As a result, Mirant recognized a reduction in
other postretirement liabilities of $32 million. Since the amendment occurred after the 2006 measurement date, the plan curtailment was recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2007.  F-31

Employee Savings Plan The Company maintains a defined contribution employee savings plan with a profit sharing arrangement whereby employees may contribute a portion of their base compensation to the employee savings plan, subject to
limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company provides a matching contribution each payroll period equal to 75% of the employees contributions up to 6% of the employees pay for that period. For unionized employees, matching levels
vary by bargaining unit. Under the profit sharing arrangement, the Company contributes a quarterly fixed contribution of 3% of eligible
pay and may make an annual discretionary contribution for those employees not accruing a benefit under the defined benefit pension plan. Expenses recognized for the matching and profit sharing contributions were as follows (in millions):

Table of ContentsStock-based Compensation The Mirant Corporation 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan for certain employees and directors of Mirant became effective on January 3, 2006. The Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for the granting of nonqualified stock
options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, other stock-based awards, covered employee annual incentive awards and non-employee
director awards. Under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, 18,575,851 shares of Mirant common stock are available for issuance to participants. Shares covered by an award are counted as used only to the extent that they are actually issued. Any shares
related to awards that terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance of such shares will be available again for grant under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Company had both service condition and performance
condition forms of stock-based compensation at December 31, 2007. On October 5, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors approved the implementation of a special bonus plan to reward participants for successful completion of the Companys planned business and asset sales as well as to provide certain participants with an incentive to remain with the
Company. The grants consisted of cash and restricted stock units. On November 13, 2006, the Companys Compensation Committee, pursuant to the Companys 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan, awarded certain equity grants to five executive
management members. The grants consist of options to acquire the Companys common stock and restricted stock units. These grants were considered performance condition awards, as the payout under the November 13, 2006, awards was based on
achieving certain target amounts related to the sales of the Companys Philippine and Caribbean businesses and six natural gas-fired facilities in the United States. The performance conditions were met at December 31, 2007, and the awards
become fully vested and non forfeitable on June 30, 2008. SFAS 123R was adopted by the Company during the first quarter of 2006,
using the modified prospective transition method. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized approximately $21 million and $8 million of compensation expense, respectively, related to service condition and performance
condition stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recognized approximately $16 million and $1 million, respectively, related to service condition and performance condition stock-based compensation. These
amounts are included in operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued
operations, net. Prior to the Companys adoption of SFAS No.123R, Mirant accounted for stock-based employee compensation plans under
the intrinsic-value method of accounting for recognition, but disclosed fair value pro forma information. Under that method, compensation expense for employee stock options is measured on the date of grant only if the current market price of the
underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. The following table illustrates the effect on net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, if the fair-value-based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested stock-based awards
(in millions):

All share-based payment awards issued prior to the Companys emergence from bankruptcy were
cancelled. As a result, the presentation of information above for the year ended December 31, 2005, is not comparable to the information that follows for the years ending December 31, 2006 and 2007. Additionally, the Companys 
 F-35 
Table of Contents
pre-bankruptcy capital structure differed significantly from the Companys post-emergence capital structure, further degrading comparability between the
pre-emergence and post-emergence periods. As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately $24 million and $3 million, respectively,
of total unrecognized compensation cost, excluding estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested share-based compensation granted through service condition and performance condition awards, which is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis
over a weighted average period of 1 year. Stock Options The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the following table. As a result of the Companys bankruptcy and
other factors, historical information concerning the Companys stock price volatility for purposes of valuing stock option grants is not sufficient. Therefore, the implied volatility derived from peer group companies was used as the basis for
valuing the stock options granted through September 30, 2006. Beginning in the fourth quarter 2006, the Company re-evaluated the use of implied volatility derived from peer group companies and determined that sufficient evidence existed to
place exclusive reliance on Mirants own implied volatility of its traded options in accordance with SAB 107. As a result of the lack of exercise history for the Company, the simplified method for estimating expected term has been used in
accordance with SAB 107, to the extent applicable. For performance condition awards, the Company utilized the contractual term as the expected term. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual term of the stock option is based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The table below includes significant assumptions used in valuing the Companys stock options:

Service Condition Awards During 2006, Mirant made awards of nonqualified stock options to purchase approximately 3 million shares. These stock options were granted with a 10-year term. Options to purchase approximately 1.8 million
shares vest 25% six months from the grant date, and 25% on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. Options to purchase approximately 1.1 million shares vest in three equal installments on each of the first, second
and third anniversaries of the grant date. Options to purchase approximately 41,000 shares were granted to non-management members of the Board of Directors and vest one year from the grant date. During 2007, the Company granted options to purchase a total of approximately 605,000 shares. These stock options were granted with a five-year term, and
vest in three equal installments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. Options to purchase approximately 15,000 shares were granted to non-management members of the Board of Directors and vest one year from the
grant date. The granted options provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change of control (as defined in the Omnibus Incentive Plan)
or, in certain circumstances, as a result of a termination of employment. Options to purchase approximately 1.1 million and 525,000 shares vested during 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which approximately 177,000 and 87,000 respectively, became
exercisable as a result of accelerated vesting resulting

ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, was approximately $10 million and $583,000, respectively, and no tax benefit was realized during the years then ended. Performance Condition Awards On November 13, 2006, Mirant made awards of nonqualified stock options to purchase
approximately 830,000 shares to five members of executive management. These options were granted with a 3-year term and vest on June 30, 2008, provided that the Company achieved the performance target amounts by December 31, 2007, which it
did. The options provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change of control (as defined in the Omnibus Incentive Plan) or, in certain circumstances, as a result of a termination of employment. As of December 31, 2007, options to purchase
approximately 100,000 shares became exercisable as a result of accelerated vesting resulting from the termination of an employee. The weighted average grant date fair value of performance condition stock options granted during the year ended
December 31, 2006, was $6.08 per share. There were no performance condition stock options granted during 2007.  F-37

Asset Retirement Obligations Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS 143, which requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. Additionally, effective December 31, 2005, the
Company adopted FIN 47, which expands the scope of asset retirement obligations to be recognized to include asset retirement obligations that may be uncertain as to the nature or timing of settlement. Upon initial recognition of a liability for
an asset retirement obligation or a conditional asset retirement obligation, an entity shall capitalize an asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the
liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of SFAS 143 and FIN 47
are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The Company identified certain asset retirement obligations within its power generating facilities. These asset retirement obligations are primarily
related to asbestos abatement in facilities on owned or leased property and other environmental obligations related to fuel storage facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, ash disposal sites and pipelines. Asbestos abatement is the most significant type of asset retirement obligation identified for recognition in the Companys adoption of FIN 47.
The EPA has regulations in place governing the removal of asbestos. Due to the nature of asbestos, it can be difficult to ascertain the extent of contamination in older facilities unless substantial renovation or demolition takes place. Therefore,
the Company incorporated certain assumptions based on the relative age and size of its facilities to estimate the current cost for asbestos abatement. The actual abatement cost could differ from the estimates used to measure the asset retirement
obligation. As a result, these amounts will be subject to revision when actual abatement activities are undertaken. The following table
sets forth the balances of the asset retirement obligations as of January 1, 2006, and the additions and accretion of the asset retirement obligations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The asset retirement obligations are
included in noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (in millions):

Commitments and Contingencies Mirant has made
firm commitments to buy materials and services in connection with its ongoing operations and has made financial guarantees relative to some of its investments. Cash Collateral In order to sell power and purchase fuel in the forward markets and perform other energy trading
and marketing activities, the Company often is required to provide trade credit support to its counterparties or make deposits with brokers. In addition, the Company often is required to provide cash collateral for access to the transmission grid to
participate in power pools and for other operating activities. In the event of default by the Company, the counterparty can apply cash collateral held to satisfy the existing amounts outstanding under an open contract. The following is a summary of cash collateral posted with counterparties as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (in millions):

Operating Leases Mirant Mid-Atlantic leases the Morgantown and Dickerson baseload units and associated property through 2034 and 2029, respectively. Mirant Mid-Atlantic has an option to extend the leases. Any extensions of the
respective leases would be limited to 75% of the economic useful life of the facility, as measured from the beginning of the original lease term through the end of the proposed remaining lease term. The Company is accounting for these leases as
operating leases and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis. Rent expense totaled $96 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and $99 million for the year ended 
 F-41 
Table of Contents
December 31, 2005, and is included in operations and maintenance expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has paid approximately $330 million and $314 million, respectively, of lease payments in excess of rent expense recognized, which is recorded in prepaid rent on the consolidated balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2007, the total notional minimum lease payments for the remaining terms of the leases aggregated approximately
$2.1 billion and the aggregate termination value for the leases was approximately $1.4 billion and generally decreases over time. Mirant Mid-Atlantic leases the Morgantown and the Dickerson baseload units from third party owner lessors.
These owner lessors each own the undivided interests in these baseload generating facilities. The subsidiaries of the institutional investors who hold the membership interests in the owner lessors are called owner participants. Equity funding by the
owner participants plus transaction expenses paid by the owner participants totaled $299 million. The issuance and sale of pass through certificates raised the remaining $1.2 billion needed for the owner lessors to acquire the undivided
interests. The pass through certificates are not direct obligations of Mirant Mid-Atlantic. Each pass through certificate represents a
fractional undivided interest in one of three pass through trusts formed pursuant to three separate pass through trust agreements between Mirant Mid-Atlantic and U.S. Bank National Association (as successor in interest to State Street Bank and Trust
Company of Connecticut, National Association), as pass through trustee. The property of the pass through trusts consists of lessor notes. The lessor notes issued by an owner lessor are secured by that owner lessors undivided interest in the
lease facilities and its rights under the related lease and other financing documents. Mirant has commitments under other operating leases
with various terms and expiration dates. Minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases approximate $7 million in each of 2008, 2009 and 2010, $6 million in 2011, $5 million in 2012, and $19 million thereafter. Fuel Commitments Fuel commitments primarily relate
to long-term coal agreements and other fuel purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2007, Mirants total estimated fuel commitments were $506 million. In addition, the Company has transactions for which commercial terms have been
negotiated but for which contracts have not yet been executed. Individual transactions may or may not be binding prior to execution of a contract. Long-Term Service Agreements As of December 31, 2007, the total estimated commitments under LTSAs associated with
turbines were approximately $31 million. These commitments are payable over the terms of the respective agreements, which range from ten to twenty years. These agreements have terms that allow for cancellation of the contracts by the Company
upon the occurrence of certain events during the term of the contracts. Estimates for future commitments for the LTSAs are based on the stated payment terms in the contracts at the time of execution. These payments are subject to an annual
adjustment for inflation. Other Other represents the open purchase orders less invoices received related to open purchase orders for procurement of products and services purchased in the ordinary course of business. These include construction, maintenance and labor
activities at the Companys generating facilities. Maryland Healthy Air Act Maryland Healthy Air Act commitments are contracts and open purchase orders related to capital expenditures that the Company expects to incur to comply
with the limitations for SO2 and NOx emissions under the Maryland Healthy Air Act.  F-42 
Table of ContentsGuarantees Mirant generally conducts its business through various operating subsidiaries, which enter into contracts as a routine part of their business activities. In certain instances, the contractual obligations of such
subsidiaries are guaranteed by, or otherwise supported by, Mirant or another of its subsidiaries, including expressed guarantees or letters of credit issued under the credit facilities of Mirant North America. In addition, Mirant and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnification and guarantee provisions. Examples of these contracts
include financing and lease arrangements, purchase and sale agreements, commodity purchase and sale agreements, construction agreements, engagement agreements with vendors and other third parties. While the primary obligation of Mirant or a
subsidiary under such contracts is to pay money or render performance, such contracts may include obligations to indemnify the counterparty for damages arising from the breach thereof and, in certain instances, other existing or potential
liabilities. In many cases, the Companys maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since some of the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential liability. Upon issuance or modification of a guarantee, the Company determines if the obligation is subject to initial recognition and measurement of a liability
and/or disclosure of the nature and terms of the guarantee. Generally, guarantees of the performance of a third party are subject to the recognition and measurement, as well as the disclosure provisions, of FIN 45. Such guarantees must initially be
recorded at fair value, as determined in accordance with the interpretation. The Company did not have any guarantees that met the recognition requirements under FIN 45 at December 31, 2007. Alternatively, guarantees between and on behalf of entities under common control are subject only to the disclosure provisions of the interpretation. The
Company must disclose information as to the term of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future gross payments (undiscounted) under the guarantee, even if the likelihood of a claim is remote. Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2007,
Mirant and its subsidiaries were contingently obligated for $290 million under letters of credit issued under the credit facilities of Mirant North America, which includes $199 million letters of credit issued pursuant to its senior secured
term loan and $91 million letters of credit issued pursuant to its revolving credit facility. Most of these letters of credit are issued in support of the obligations of Mirant North America and its subsidiaries to perform under commodity
agreements, financing or lease agreements or other commercial arrangements. In the event of default by the Company, the counterparty can draw on a letter of credit to satisfy the existing amounts outstanding under an open contract. A majority of
these letters of credit expire within one year of issuance, and it is typical for them to be renewed on similar terms. Following is a
summary of letters of credit issued as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (in millions):

Table of ContentsPurchase and Sale Guarantees and Indemnifications In connection with the purchase or sale of an asset or a business by Mirant or a subsidiary, Mirant is typically required to provide certain assurances
to the counterparties for the performance of the obligations of such a subsidiary under the purchase or sale agreements. Such assurances may take the form of a guarantee issued by Mirant or a subsidiary on behalf of the obligor subsidiary. The scope
of such guarantees would typically include any indemnity obligations owed to such counterparty. While the terms thereof vary in the scope, exclusions, thresholds and applicable limits, the indemnity obligations of a seller typically include
liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a purchase and sale agreement, including the indemnifying partys representations or warranties, unpaid and unreserved tax liabilities and specified retained liabilities, if any. These obligations
generally have a term of 12 months from the closing date and are intended to protect the non-indemnifying parties against breaches of the agreement or risks that are difficult to predict or estimate at the time of the transaction. In most cases, the
contract limits the liability of the indemnifying party. Subject to certain standard exclusions, the potential indemnity exposure of Mirant under the recent sales of its Caribbean business, its Philippine business and its six U.S. natural gas-fired
facilities is limited to fifteen percent (15%), ten percent (10%) and ten percent (10%) of the respective sale prices. As of December 31, 2007, Mirant and its subsidiaries contingent obligation for such assurances was $532
million. The Company does not expect that it will be required to make any material payments under these guarantee and indemnity provisions. Commercial
Purchase and Sales Arrangements In connection with the purchase and sale of fuel, emission allowances and energy to and from third
parties with respect to the operation of Mirants generating facilities, the Company may be required to guarantee a portion of the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries. These obligations may include liquidated damages payments or other
unscheduled payments. The majority of the guarantees are set to expire before the end of 2010, although the obligations of the issuer will remain in effect until all the liabilities created under the guarantee have been satisfied or no longer exist.
As of December 31, 2007, Mirant and its subsidiaries were contingently obligated for a total of $93 million under such arrangements. The Company does not expect that it will be required to make any material payments under these guarantees.
Other Guarantees and Indemnifications As of December 31, 2007, Mirant has issued $67 million of guarantees of obligations that its subsidiaries may incur as a provision for construction agreements, equipment leases, and on-going litigation. The Company does not expect that
it will be required to make any material payments under these guarantees. The Company, through its subsidiaries, participates in several
power pools with RTOs. The rules of these RTOs require that each participant indemnify the pool for defaults by other members. Usually, the amount indemnified is based upon the activity of the participant relative to the total activity of the pool
and the amount of the default. Consequently, the amount of such indemnification by the Company cannot be quantified. On a routine basis in
the ordinary course of business, Mirant and its subsidiaries indemnify financing parties and consultants or other vendors who provide services to the Company. The Company does not expect that it will be required to make any material payments under
these indemnity provisions. Because some of the guarantees and indemnities Mirant issues to third parties do not limit the amount or
duration of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described above. For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit the Companys liability exposure, the
Company may not be able to estimate its potential liability until a claim is made for payment or performance, because of the contingent nature of these contracts.  F-44

Dispositions Overview The Company had no assets or liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2007. Assets and liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2006,
included discontinued operations and other assets that the Company disposed of in 2007. In the third quarter of 2006, Mirant commenced separate auction processes to sell its Philippine (2,203 MW) and Caribbean
(1,050 MW) businesses and six U.S. natural gas-fired facilities totaling 3,619 MW, consisting of the Zeeland (903 MW), West Georgia (613 MW), Shady Hills (469 MW), Sugar Creek (561 MW), Bosque
(546 MW) and Apex (527 MW) facilities. The sale of the six U.S. natural gas-fired facilities was completed on
May 1, 2007. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $396 million to reduce the carrying value of the six facilities held for sale to estimated fair value. In subsequent periods, the Company recorded
reductions to the impairment loss of approximately $51 million resulting from the sale process. As a result, the Company recognized a cumulative loss of $345 million related to the sale of the six facilities. The net proceeds to Mirant after
transaction costs and retiring $83 million of project-related debt were $1.306 billion. The Company completed the sale of Mirant
NY-Gen on May 7, 2007. The Company recognized a gain of $8 million related to the sale. The proceeds related to the sale were immaterial as a result of the transfer of the net liabilities of Mirant New York-Gen. The sale of the Philippine business was completed on June 22, 2007. The Company recognized a gain of $2.003 billion related to the sale. The net
proceeds to Mirant after transaction costs and the repayment of $642 million of debt were $3.21 billion. The sale of the Caribbean
business was completed on August 8, 2007. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $63 million in the third quarter of 2007 related to the sale. The net proceeds to Mirant after transaction costs were $555 million. The gain and
net proceeds are subject to final working capital adjustments. The table below presents the components of the balance sheet accounts

Table of ContentsDuring the second quarter of 2007, the Company recognized $9 million of other comprehensive income,
net of tax, related to the sale of the Philippine business. Of this amount, $5 million was related to a pension liability that was settled as part of the sale and $4 million was related to a cumulative translation adjustment. During the
third quarter of 2007, the Company recognized $11 million of other comprehensive loss, net of tax, related to pension and other postretirement benefits as part of the sale of the Caribbean business. Discontinued Operations The Company has
reclassified amounts for prior periods in the financial statements to report separately, as discontinued operations, the revenues and expenses of components of the Company that have been disposed of as of December 31, 2007. The Company sold its Wrightsville power generating facility in 2005, but retained transmission credits that arose from transmission system upgrades
associated with the construction of the Wrightsville facility. During the third quarter of 2007, Mirant entered into an agreement that established the amount of the outstanding transmission credits. As a result of the agreement, Mirant recognized a
gain of $24 million in income from discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
income from discontinued operations included the results of operations of the Caribbean business, the Philippine business, the six U.S. natural gas-fired facilities and Mirant NY-Gen through their respective dates of sale and the gain related to
Wrightsville described above. For the year ended December 31, 2006, income from discontinued operations included the results of operations of all the discontinued businesses and assets for the entire year, as well as the Wichita Falls facility
in Texas through its May 2006 date of sale. For the year ended December 31, 2005, income from discontinued operations also included the results of operations of the Wrightsville generating facility through its date of sale in the third
quarter of 2005. A summary of the operating results for these discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005 is as follows (in millions):

On July 12, 2006, the Companys Sual generating facility in the Philippines had an
unplanned outage of unit 2 as a result of a failure of the generator. The repairs on unit 2 were completed on March 4, 2007, and the unit returned to operation. On October 23, 2006, unit 1 at the Sual generating facility had
an unplanned outage as a result of a failure of the generator. The repairs on unit 1 were completed on June 12, 2007, and the unit returned to operation. As part of the sale of the Philippine business, Mirant retained the rights to future insurance recoveries related to the Sual outages. In 2007, the Company received a total of $23 million related to these
recoveries. Additional recoveries will be recognized in discontinued operations when outstanding claims are resolved. As part of the sale
of Mirant NY-Gen, Mirant retained the rights to future insurance recoveries related to repairs of the dam at the Swinging Bridge facility. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company reached an insurance settlement and recognized a gain of $10
million, which is included in income from discontinued operations.  

12.
Bankruptcy Related Disclosures Mirants Plan
was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on December 9, 2005, and the Company emerged from bankruptcy on January 3, 2006. For financial statement presentation purposes, Mirant recorded the effects of the Plan at December 31, 2005.
At December 31, 2007 and 2006, amounts related to allowed claims, estimated unresolved claims and professional fees associated with
the bankruptcy that are to be settled in cash were $27 million and $28 million, respectively, and these amounts were recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These amounts do not include
unresolved claims that will be settled in common stock or the stock portion of claims that are expected to be settled with cash and stock. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company paid approximately $53 million in cash related to
bankruptcy claims, which is reflected in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company paid approximately $1.849 billion, in cash related to bankruptcy claims. Of this amount,
approximately $990 million is reflected in cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations and $45 million from discontinued operations and together represent the principal amount of debt claims. As of December 31, 2007,
approximately one million of the shares of Mirant common stock to be distributed under the Plan have not yet been distributed and have been reserved for distribution with respect to claims that are disputed by the Mirant Debtors and have yet to be
resolved. See Note 18 for further discussion of the Chapter 11 proceedings.  F-47 
Table of ContentsMirant New York Subsidiaries The Companys New York subsidiaries, Mirant New York, Mirant Bowline, Mirant Lovett, Hudson Valley Gas and Mirant NY-Gen, remained in bankruptcy at December 31, 2006. On January 26, 2007, Mirant New
York, Mirant Bowline (which owns the Bowline facility) and Hudson Valley Gas (collectively the Emerging New York Entities) filed their Supplemental Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court and subsequently filed
amendments to that plan (as subsequently amended, the Supplemental Plan). The Supplemental Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on March 23, 2007, and became effective on April 16, 2007, resulting in the Emerging New York
Entities emergence from bankruptcy. For financial statement presentation purposes, the effects of the Supplemental Plan were recorded on March 31, 2007. On January 31, 2007, Mirant New York entered into an agreement for the sale of Mirant NY-Gen, which owned the Hillburn and Shoemaker gas turbine facilities and the Swinging Bridge, Rio and Mongaup
hydroelectric generating facilities. The sale closed on May 7, 2007, and the Company recognized a gain of $8 million. Mirant NY-Gen emerged from bankruptcy under a plan of reorganization that incorporated the sale and was approved by the
Bankruptcy Court on April 27, 2007. On July 13, 2007, Mirant Lovett (which owns the Lovett facility) filed a plan of
reorganization (the Mirant Lovett Plan) with the Bankruptcy Court. The Mirant Lovett Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on September 19, 2007, and became effective on October 2, 2007, resulting in Mirant Lovetts
emergence from bankruptcy. For financial statement presentation purposes, the effects of the Mirant Lovett Plan were recorded on September 30, 2007. As a result of Mirant Lovetts emergence, Mirant has no subsidiaries that remain in
bankruptcy. See Note 18 for further discussion regarding Mirant Lovetts emergence from bankruptcy. Reorganization Items, net 
Reorganization items, net represents expense, income and gain or loss amounts that were recorded in the financial statements as a result
of the bankruptcy proceedings. In 2006, reorganization items, net relate to refunds received from various New York tax jurisdictions for the settlement of the property tax dispute related to the New York subsidiaries. Reorganization items, net for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, are comprised of the following (in millions):

Estimated claims and losses on rejected and amended contracts relate primarily to rejected energy contracts, such as tolling agreements and gas transportation and electric
transmission contracts. Interest Expense In the third quarter of 2005, the Company determined that it was probable that contractual interest on liabilities subject to compromise from the Petition Date would be incurred for certain claims expected to be
allowed under Mirants Plan. As a result, the Company recorded interest expense of approximately $1.4 billion in 2005 on liabilities subject to compromise. This amount represents interest from the Petition Date through the effective date
of the Plan. The interest amount was calculated based on the provisions of the Plan. The $1.4 billion expense amount included approximately $450 million related to Mirant Americas Generation senior notes maturing in 2011, 2021 and 2031,
which were reinstated under the confirmed Plan.  F-48

Stockholders Equity On January 3,
2006, all shares of Mirants old common stock were cancelled and 300 million shares of Mirants new common stock were issued. At December 31, 2007, approximately one million shares of common stock are reserved for unresolved
claims pursuant to Mirants emergence from bankruptcy. Mirant also issued two series of warrants that will expire on January 3,
2011. The Series A and Series B warrants entitle the holders to purchase an aggregate of approximately 35 million and 18 million shares of New Mirant common stock, respectively. The exercise price of the Series A and
Series B warrants is $21.87 and $20.54 per share, respectively. The exercise price and number of common shares issuable are subject to adjustments based on the occurrence of certain events, including (1) dividends or distributions,
(2) rights offerings or (3) other distributions. Mirants common stock is currently traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol MIR. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 182,000 and 88,000 of Series A warrants,
respectively and 463,000 and 11,000 of Series B warrants, respectively, have been exercised. At December 31, 2007, 35,023,201 and 17,172,929 of Series A and Series B warrants, respectively, remain outstanding. On January 3, 2006, the Omnibus Incentive Plan for certain employees and directors of Mirant became effective. Under the Omnibus Incentive Plan,
18,575,851 shares of Mirant common stock are available for issuance to participants. See Note 8 for further discussion of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company repurchased 43 million shares of Mirant common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.228 billion. On September 28, 2006, the Company
announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a $100 million share repurchase program which expired in September 2007. As of September 30, 2007, the Company had repurchased 1.18 million shares under this program. In January 2007, the Company began a program of repurchasing shares at market prices from stockholders holding less than 100 shares of Mirant stock.
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 245,000 shares for approximately $9 million. In the
fourth quarter of 2007, the Company announced that it would return a total of $4.6 billion of excess cash to its stockholders. Mirant entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association, London
Branch (JP Morgan). Under the terms of the accelerated share repurchase program, Mirant repurchased 26.66 million shares of its outstanding common stock from JP Morgan, for a total of $1 billion based on the closing price of
Mirants common stock on November 9, 2007. Upon receipt of the shares, the accelerated share repurchase program met the necessary criteria to be accounted for as an equity contract. As such, changes in the fair value will not be recorded
in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Under the accelerated share repurchase program, the final price of shares repurchased will be determined based on a discount to the volume weighted average trading price of Mirants
common stock over a period not to exceed six months. Depending on the final price and number of shares repurchased, JP Morgan may deliver additional shares to Mirant at the completion of the transaction, or Mirant may deliver to JP Morgan either
cash or shares that were previously delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement. In addition to the accelerated share repurchase program, the Company also entered into an open market purchase agreement with JP Morgan Securities, Inc.
to purchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had purchased approximately 8.27 million shares in open market purchases for approximately $316 million. Between January 1, 2008 and
February 25, 2008, the Company purchased an additional 7.9 million shares in open market purchases for approximately $286 million. On February 29, 2008, the Company announced that it had decided to return the remaining $2.6 billion of
cash through open market purchases of common stock but that it would continue to evaluate the most efficient method to return the cash to stockholders.  F-49

Earnings per Share On January 3, 2006, all
shares of Mirants old common stock were cancelled and 300 million shares of new common stock were issued. Mirant also issued two series of warrants that will expire on January 3, 2011. Therefore, earnings per share information for
2005 has not been presented because the information is not relevant in any material respect for users of its financial statements. Mirant
calculates basic EPS by dividing income available to stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS gives effect to dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted shares and restricted stock
units, stock options and warrants. The Company excluded 465,024 and 3.4 million of potential common shares representing antidilutive stock options from the earnings per share calculations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (in

Litigation and Other Contingencies The Company is
involved in a number of significant legal proceedings. In certain cases, plaintiffs seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified damages, and some matters may be unresolved for several years. The Company cannot currently determine the outcome of
the proceedings described below or the ultimate amount of potential losses and therefore has not made any provision for such matters unless specifically noted below. Pursuant to SFAS 5, management provides for estimated losses to the extent
information becomes available indicating that losses are probable and that the amounts are reasonably estimable. Additional losses could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.  F-54 
Table of ContentsEnvironmental Matters Kivalina Suit.    On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
against several owners of generating facilities, including Mirant Corporation, several oil companies and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska that they contend is being destroyed by erosion
allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The Plaintiffs assert claims for nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and for the cost of relocating the village, which cost is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. Mirant intends to oppose this action vigorously,
but cannot predict its outcome. EPA Information Request.    In January 2001, the EPA issued a request for
information to Mirant concerning the implications under the EPAs NSR regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act of past repair and maintenance activities at the Potomac River facility in Virginia and the Chalk Point, Dickerson and
Morgantown facilities in Maryland. The requested information concerned the period of operations that predates the Company subsidiaries ownership and lease of those facilities. Mirant responded fully to this request. Under the APSA, Pepco is
responsible for fines and penalties arising from any violation associated with operations prior to the acquisition or lease of the facilities by subsidiaries of the Company. If a violation is determined to have occurred at any of the facilities, the
Company subsidiary owning or leasing the facility may be responsible for the cost of purchasing and installing emissions control equipment, the cost of which may be material. The Companys subsidiaries owning or leasing the Chalk Point,
Dickerson and Morgantown facilities in Maryland are installing a variety of emissions control equipment on those facilities to comply with the Maryland Healthy Air Act, but that equipment may not include all of the emissions control equipment that
could be required if a violation of the EPAs NSR regulations is determined to have occurred at one or more of those facilities. If such a violation is determined to have occurred after the Companys subsidiaries acquired or leased the
facilities or, if occurring prior to the acquisition or lease, is determined to constitute a continuing violation, the Companys subsidiary owning or leasing the facility at issue could also be subject to fines and penalties by the state or
federal government for the period after its acquisition or lease of the facility, the cost of which may be material, although applicable bankruptcy law may bar such liability for periods prior to January 3, 2006, when the Plan became effective
for the Company and its subsidiaries that own or lease these facilities. Morgantown Particulate Emissions
NOV.    On March 3, 2006, Mirant Mid-Atlantic received a notice sent on behalf of the MDE alleging that violations of particulate matter emissions limits applicable to unit 1 at the Morgantown facility occurred on
nineteen days in June and July 2005. The notice advises that the potential civil penalty is up to $25,000 per day for each day that unit 1 exceeded the applicable particulate matter limit. The letter further advises that the MDE has asked the
Maryland Attorney General to file a civil suit under Maryland law based upon the alleged violations. Morgantown SO2
Exceedances.    Mirant Mid-Atlantic received an NOV dated March 8, 2006, asserting that on three days in June 2005 and January 2006, the Morgantown facility exceeded SO2 emissions limitations specified in its air permit.
The NOV indicates that on two of those days the SO2 emissions limitation was exceeded by two different units of the Morgantown facility each day. The NOV did not seek a specific penalty amount but noted that the violations identified could subject
Mirant Mid-Atlantic to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day. Morgantown Emissions Observation NOV.    On
June 30, 2006, the MDE issued an NOV to Mirant Mid-Atlantic indicating that it had failed to comply with the air permit for the Morgantown facility by operating the combustion turbines at the facility for more than 168 hours without performing
an EPA Reference Method 9 observation of stack emissions for an 18-minute period. The NOV did not seek a specific penalty amount but noted that the violation identified could subject Mirant Mid-Atlantic to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day.
Mirant Potomac River NAAQS Exceedance.    On March 23, 2007, the Virginia DEQ issued an NOV to Mirant
Potomac River alleging that it violated Virginias Air Pollution Control Law and regulations on February 23, 2007, by operating the Potomac River facility in a manner that resulted in a monitored exceedance 
 F-55 
Table of Contents
in a twenty-four hour period of the NAAQS for SO2. As noted in the NOV, Mirant Potomac River was operating on February 23, 2007, as directed by PJM in
accordance with a DOE order during a scheduled outage of the Pepco transmission lines serving Washington, D.C. The NOV asserts that plant operators did not implement appropriate actions to minimize SO2 emissions. The NOV did not seek a specific
penalty amount but noted that the violations identified could subject Mirant Potomac River to civil penalties of varying amounts under different provisions of the Virginia Code, including a potential civil fine of up to $100,000. New York State Administrative Claim.    On January 24, 2006, the State of New York and the NYSDEC filed a notice of
administrative claims in the Companys Chapter 11 proceedings asserting a claim seeking to require the Company to provide funding to its subsidiaries owning generating facilities in New York to satisfy certain specified environmental compliance
obligations. The State of New York cited various existing outstanding matters between the State and the Companys subsidiaries owning generating facilities in New York related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The State of
New York and the NYSDEC executed a stipulated order with the Company, its New York subsidiaries and the other Mirant Debtors to stay resolution of this administrative claim. That stipulated order was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on
February 23, 2006. Although this administrative claim remains stayed, the bulk of the existing outstanding matters upon which the claim was based have been separately resolved with the NYSDEC. Riverkeeper Suit Against Mirant Lovett.    On March 11, 2005, Riverkeeper, Inc. filed suit against Mirant Lovett in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the Clean Water Act. The suit alleges that Mirant Lovett failed to implement a marine life exclusion system at its Lovett generating facility and to perform monitoring for
the exclusion of certain aquatic organisms from the facilitys cooling water intake structures in violation of Mirant Lovetts water discharge permit issued by the State of New York. The plaintiff requested the court to enjoin Mirant
Lovett from continuing to operate the Lovett generating facility in a manner that allegedly violates the Clean Water Act, to impose civil penalties of $32,500 per day of violation, and to award the plaintiff attorneys fees. Mirant
Lovetts view is that it has complied with the terms of its water discharge permit, as amended by a Consent Order entered June 29, 2004. On April 20, 2005, the district court approved a stipulation agreed to by the plaintiff and
Mirant Lovett that stayed the suit until 60 days after the entry of the order by the Bankruptcy Court confirming the plan of reorganization for Mirant Lovett became final and non-appealable, which stay expired in late 2007. Lovett/Bowline SPDES Notices of Violation.    On March 8, 2007, Mirant Lovett and Mirant Bowline received NOVs from the
NYSDEC alleging certain violations of their State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) permits. On April 6, 2007, the NYSDEC filed a complaint against Mirant Lovett and Mirant Bowline based on these allegations. The
complaint seeks a penalty of $500,000. On December 31, 2007, Mirant Bowline entered into a Consent Order with the NYSDEC that resolved the NOV issued to it. In the Consent Order, Mirant Bowline agreed to pay a fine of $50,000 and to fund an
environmental benefit project in the amount of $250,000. Mirant Lovett is in discussions with the NYSDEC to resolve the NOV issued to it and has not yet responded to the complaint filed by the NYSDEC. Notices of Intent to Sue for Alleged Violations of the Endangered Species Act.    Mirant and Mirant Delta have received two
letters, one dated September 27, 2007, sent on behalf of the Coalition for a Sustainable Delta, four water districts, and an individual and the second dated October 16, 2007, sent on behalf of San Francisco Baykeeper (collectively with the
parties sending the September 27, 2007, letter, the Noticing Parties), providing notice that the Noticing Parties intend to file suit alleging that Mirant Delta has violated, and continues to violate, the federal Endangered Species
Act through the operation of its Contra Costa and Pittsburg generating facilities. The Noticing Parties contend that the facilities use of water drawn from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for cooling purposes results in harm to four species of fish
listed as endangered species. The Noticing Parties assert that Mirant Deltas authorizations to take (i.e., cause harm to) those species, a biological opinion and incidental take statement issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service on
October 17, 2002, for three of the fish species and a biological opinion and incidental take statement issued by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on November 4, 2002, for the fourth fish species have not been complied with by
Mirant Delta and no longer apply to permit the effects on the four fish species caused by the operation of the Contra Costa and Pittsburg generating facilities. Following receipt of these letters, in late October 2007, Mirant Delta received 
 F-56 
Table of Contents
correspondence from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Army Corps of Engineers clarifying that Mirant Delta
continued to be authorized to take the four species of fish protected under the federal Endangered Species Act. In a subsequent letter, the Coalition for a Sustainable Delta also alleged violations of the National Environmental Policy Act and the
California Endangered Species Act associated with the operation of Mirant Deltas facilities. Mirant Delta disputes the allegations made by the Noticing Parties. No lawsuits have been filed to date, and San Francisco Baykeeper on
February 1, 2008, withdrew its notice of intent to sue. Chapter 11 Proceedings On July 14, 2003, and various dates thereafter, Mirant Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Mirant Debtors)
filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. Mirant and most of the Mirant Debtors emerged from bankruptcy on January 3, 2006, when the Plan became effective. The remaining Mirant
Debtors, Mirant New York, Mirant Bowline, Mirant Lovett, Mirant NY-Gen and Hudson Valley Corporation, emerged from bankruptcy on various dates in 2007. As of December 31, 2007, approximately one million of the shares of Mirant common stock to
be distributed under the Plan had not yet been distributed and have been reserved for distribution with respect to claims disputed by the Mirant Debtors that have not been resolved. Under the terms of the Plan, to the extent unresolved claims are
resolved now that Mirant has emerged from bankruptcy, the claimants will receive the same pro rata distributions of Mirant common stock, cash, or both common stock and cash as previously allowed claims. To the extent the aggregate amount of the payouts determined to be due with respect to disputed claims ultimately exceeds the amount of the funded claim
reserve, Mirant would have to issue additional shares of common stock to address the shortfall, which would dilute existing Mirant stockholders, and Mirant and Mirant Americas Generation would have to pay additional cash amounts as necessary under
the terms of the Plan to satisfy such pre-petition claims. If Mirant is required to issue additional shares of common stock to satisfy unresolved claims, certain parties who received approximately 21 million of the 300 million shares of
common stock distributed under the Plan are entitled to receive additional shares of common stock to avoid dilution of their distributions under the Plan. Actions Pursued by MC Asset Recovery In 2005, Mirant Corporation and various of its subsidiaries filed actions in
the Bankruptcy Court against several parties seeking to recover damages for fraudulent transfers that occurred prior to the filing of Mirants bankruptcy proceedings, and asserting other related claims. Each of those actions alleges that the
defendants engaged in transactions with Mirant or its subsidiaries at a time when they were insolvent or were rendered insolvent by the resulting transfers and that they did not receive fair value for those transfers. In addition to these avoidance
actions, the official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation filed an action against Arthur Andersen on behalf of the Mirant Debtors alleging malpractice. Under the Plan, the rights to most of these avoidance actions, and the suit
filed against Arthur Andersen, were transferred to MC Asset Recovery. MC Asset Recovery, while wholly-owned by Mirant, is governed by managers that are independent of Mirant and its other subsidiaries. Mirant is obligated to make capital
contributions to MC Asset Recovery as necessary to pay up to $20 million of professional fees and to pay certain other costs incurred by MC Asset Recovery, including expert witness fees and other costs of the avoidance actions and the Andersen
suit, which costs are not capped and for which Mirant has accrued $45 million. Under the Plan, any cash recoveries received by MC Asset
Recovery from the avoidance actions or the Andersen suit, net of costs incurred in prosecuting the actions (including all capital contributions from Mirant), are to be paid to the unsecured creditors of Mirant Corporation in the Chapter 11
proceedings and the holders of the equity interests in Mirant Corporation immediately prior to the effective date of the Plan except where such a recovery results in an allowed claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, as described below. Mirant may not
reduce such payments for the taxes owed on any net recoveries up to $175 million. If the aggregate recoveries exceed $175 million net of costs, then Mirant may reduce the payments to be made to such unsecured creditors and former holders
of equity interests under the Plan by the amount of any taxes it will owe on the amount in excess of $175 million. Most of the actions transferred to MC Asset Recovery remain pending, and through December 31, 2007, none of those actions
has resulted in any recovery.  F-57 
Table of ContentsIf MC Asset Recovery succeeds in obtaining any recoveries on the avoidance claims transferred to it, the
party or parties from which such recoveries are obtained could seek to file claims in Mirants bankruptcy proceedings. Mirant would vigorously contest any such claims on the grounds that, among other things, the avoidance claims being pursued
by MC Asset Recovery seek to recover only amounts received by third parties in excess of fair value and that the recovery of such amounts does not reinstate any enforceable pre-petition obligation that could give rise to a claim. If such a claim
were to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court as a result of a recovery by MC Asset Recovery, then the party receiving the claim would be entitled to either Mirant common stock or such stock and cash as provided under the Plan. Under such
circumstances, the order entered by the Bankruptcy Court on December 9, 2005, confirming the Plan provides that Mirant would retain from the net amount recovered an amount equal to the dollar amount of the resulting allowed claim rather than
distribute such amount to the creditors and former equity holders as described above. California and Western Power Markets FERC Refund Proceedings Arising Out of California Energy Crisis.    High prices experienced in California and western
wholesale electricity markets in 2000 and 2001 caused various purchasers of electricity in those markets to initiate proceedings seeking refunds. Several of those proceedings remain pending either before the FERC or on appeal to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the Ninth Circuit). The proceedings that remain pending include proceedings (1) ordered by FERC on July 25, 2001, (the FERC Refund Proceedings) to determine the amount of any
refunds and amounts owed for sales made by market participants, including Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, in the CAISO or the Cal PX markets from October 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001 (the Refund Period), (2) ordered by
FERC to determine whether there had been unjust and unreasonable charges for spot market bilateral sales in the Pacific Northwest from December 25, 2000, through June 20, 2001 (the Pacific Northwest Proceeding), and
(3) arising from a complaint filed in 2002 by the California Attorney General that sought refunds for transactions conducted in markets administered by the CAISO and the Cal PX outside the Refund Period set by the FERC and for transactions
between the DWR and various owners of generation and power marketers, including Mirant Americas Energy Marketing and subsidiaries of Mirant Americas Generation. Various parties appealed FERC orders related to these proceedings to the Ninth Circuit
seeking review of a number of issues, including changing the Refund Period to include periods prior to October 2, 2000, and expanding the sales of electricity subject to potential refund to include bilateral sales made to the DWR and other
parties. While various of these appeals remain pending, the Ninth Circuit has ruled that the FERC should consider further whether to grant relief for sales of electricity made in the CAISO and Cal PX markets prior to October 2, 2000, at rates
found to be unjust, and, in the proceeding initiated by the California Attorney General, what remedies, including potential refunds, are appropriate where entities, including Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, purportedly did not comply with certain
filing requirements for transactions conducted under market based rate tariffs. On January 14, 2005, Mirant and certain of its
subsidiaries (the Mirant Settling Parties) entered into a Settlement and Release of Claims Agreement (the California Settlement) with PG&E, Southern California Edison Company, San Diego Gas and Electric Company, the CPUC,
the DWR, the EOB and the Attorney General of the State of California (collectively, the California Parties). The California Settlement was approved by the FERC on April 13, 2005, and became effective on April 15, 2005, upon its
approval by the Bankruptcy Court. The California Settlement resulted in the release of most of Mirant Americas Energy Marketings potential liability (1) in the FERC Refund Proceedings for sales made in the CAISO or the Cal PX markets,
(2) in the Pacific Northwest Proceeding, and (3) in any proceedings at the FERC resulting from the complaint filed in 2002 by the California Attorney General. Under the California Settlement, the California Parties and those other market
participants who have opted into the settlement have released the Mirant Settling Parties, including Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, from any liability for refunds related to sales of electricity and natural gas in the western markets from
January 1, 1998, through July 14, 2003. Also, the California Parties have assumed the obligation of Mirant Americas Energy Marketing to pay any refunds determined by the FERC to be owed by Mirant Americas Energy Marketing to other parties
that do not opt into the settlement for transactions in the CAISO and Cal PX markets during the Refund Period, with the liability of the California Parties for such refund 
 F-58 
Table of Contents
obligation limited to the amount of certain receivables assigned by Mirant Americas Energy Marketing to the California Parties under the California
Settlement. The settlement did not relieve Mirant Americas Energy Marketing of liability for any refunds that the FERC determines it to owe (1) to participants in the Cal PX and CAISO markets that are not California Parties (or that did not
elect to opt into the settlement) for periods outside the Refund Period and (2) to participants in bilateral transactions with Mirant Americas Energy Marketing that are not California Parties (or that did not elect to opt into the settlement).
Resolution of the refund proceedings that remain pending before the FERC or that currently are on appeal to the Ninth Circuit could
ultimately result in the FERC concluding that the prices received by Mirant Americas Energy Marketing in some transactions occurring in 2000 and 2001 should be reduced. The Companys view is that the bulk of any obligations of Mirant Americas
Energy Marketing to make refunds as a result of sales completed prior to July 14, 2003, in the CAISO or Cal PX markets or in bilateral transactions either have been addressed by the California Settlement or have been resolved as part of Mirant
Americas Energy Marketings bankruptcy proceedings. To the extent that Mirant Americas Energy Marketings potential refund liability arises from contracts that were transferred to Mirant Energy Trading as part of the transfer of the
trading and marketing business under the Plan, Mirant Energy Trading may have exposure to any refund liability related to transactions under those contracts. FERC Show Cause Proceeding Relating to Trading Practices.    On June 25, 2003, the FERC issued a show cause order (the Trading Practices Order) to more than 50 parties,
including Mirant Americas Energy Marketing and subsidiaries of Mirant Americas Generation. The Trading Practices Order identified certain specific trading practices that the FERC indicated could constitute gaming or anomalous market behavior in
violation of the CAISO and Cal PX tariffs, and required sellers previously involved in transactions of those types to demonstrate why such transactions were not violations of the CAISO and Cal PX tariffs. On September 30, 2003, and
December 19, 2003, the Mirant entities filed with the FERC for approval of a settlement agreement (the Trading Settlement Agreement) entered into between certain Mirant entities and the FERC Trial Staff and an amendment to that
agreement, under which Mirant Americas Energy Marketing would pay $332,411 and the FERC would have an allowed unsecured claim in Mirant Americas Energy Marketings bankruptcy proceeding for $3.67 million to settle the show cause
proceeding. The FERC approved the Trading Settlement Agreement, as amended, on June 27, 2005, and the Bankruptcy Court approved it on August 24, 2005. Certain parties filed motions for rehearing with the FERC, which it denied on
October 11, 2006. A party to the proceeding has appealed the FERCs June 27, 2005, order to the Ninth Circuit. Maryland Public
Service Commission Complaint to the FERC re PJM Offer Capping Rules In certain market conditions, such as where congestion
requires the dispatch of a generating facility that bid a higher price for electricity than other available generating facilities, PJMs market rules (the Offer Capping Rules) limit the amount that the owner of a generating facility
may bid to sell electricity from that facility to its incremental cost of service to produce that electricity. As approved by the FERC, the Offer Capping Rules contain exemptions for generating facilities entering service during certain years (none
of which are owned by the Company) and for generating facilities (some of which are owned by the Company) that can relieve congestion arising at certain defined transmission interfaces. On January 15, 2008, the Maryland Public Service
Commission (the MD PSC) filed a complaint with the FERC requesting that the FERC remove all exemptions to the Offer Capping Rules during hours when the PJM market reflects potentially non-competitive conditions, as determined by the PJM
Market Monitor. The complaint alleges that these exemptions to the Offer Capping Rules likely result in higher market clearing prices for electricity in PJM, and higher revenues to the Company and the other owners of generation that are selling
electricity, during the periods when the exemptions prevent the application of the Offer Capping Rules to one or more generating facilities. The MD PSC requested that the FERC require a rerunning of the dispatch of the PJM energy markets without
application of the exemptions to the Offer Capping Rules for each day from January 15, 2008, through the date that the Commission grants the requested relief and that it require owners of generation to refund any revenues received in excess of
the amounts that would have been received had the exemptions not been applied.  F-59 
Table of ContentsIn addition, the MD PSC alleged that PJM violated its tariff by not publicly disclosing since mid 2006
quarterly analyses performed by the PJM Market Monitor of the potential for the exercise of market power by owners of generation during periods when market conditions caused the exemptions to the Offer Capping Rules to apply. The MD PSC requested
the FERC to initiate an investigation of whether owners of generation exercised market power during such periods, and, if so, to order refunds beginning as of September 8, 2006, or the first date that the FERC determines that PJM violated its
tariff. The Company disputes the allegations made by the MD PSC in its complaint and intends to oppose the complaint and the relief
requested. If the FERC were to remove the exemptions to the Offer Capping Rules, and apply the removal retroactively from January 15, 2008, or an earlier date, PJM would have to rerun its day-ahead market from that date forward to determine
what prices would have resulted in the absence of the exemptions. Such a rerun of the PJM day-ahead market likely would result in refunds being owed by all sellers, including the Company, but the potential amount cannot be quantified. Stockholder-Bondholder Litigation Mirant
Securities Consolidated Action.    Twenty lawsuits filed in 2002 against Mirant and four of its officers have been consolidated into a single action, In re Mirant Corporation Securities Litigation, before the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. In their original complaints, the plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing
public regarding Mirants business operations and future prospects during the period from January 19, 2001, through May 6, 2002, due to potential liabilities arising out of its activities in California during 2000 and 2001. The
plaintiffs sought unspecified damages, including compensatory damages, and the recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs. In
November 2002, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added as defendants the Southern Company (Southern), the directors of Mirant immediately prior to its initial public offering of stock and various firms that were
underwriters for the initial public offering by the Company. In addition to the claims set out in the original complaint, the amended complaint asserted claims under the Securities Act, alleging that the registration statement and prospectus for the
initial public offering in 2000 of Mirants old common stock cancelled under the Plan misrepresented and omitted material facts. On December 11, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a proof of claim against Mirant in the Chapter 11 proceedings, but
they subsequently withdrew their claim in October 2004. On August 29, 2005, the district court, at the request of the plaintiffs, dismissed Mirant as a defendant in this action. A master separation agreement between Mirant and Southern entered into in conjunction with Mirants spin-off from Southern in 2001 obligates Mirant
to indemnify Southern for any losses arising out of any acts or omissions by Mirant and its subsidiaries in the conduct of the business of Mirant and its subsidiaries. Mirant filed to reject the separation agreement in the Chapter 11 proceedings.
Any damages determined to be owed to Southern arising from the rejection of the separation agreement will be addressed as a claim in the Chapter 11 proceedings under the terms of the Plan. The underwriting agreements between Mirant and the various
firms added as defendants that were underwriters for the initial public offering by the Company in 2000 also provide for Mirant to indemnify such firms against any losses arising out of any acts or omissions by Mirant and its subsidiaries. The
underwriters filed a claim against Mirant in the Chapter 11 proceedings that was subordinated to claims of Mirants creditors and extinguished under the Plan. Other Legal Matters The Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  F-60

Settlements and Other Charges Pepco Litigation 
In 2000, Mirant purchased power generating facilities and other assets from Pepco, including certain PPAs between Pepco and third parties.
Under the terms of the APSA, Mirant and Pepco entered into the Back-to-Back Agreement with respect to certain PPAs, including Pepcos long-term PPA with Panda-Brandywine, LP, under which (1) Pepco agreed to resell to Mirant all capacity,
energy, ancillary services and other benefits to which it is entitled under those agreements and (2) Mirant agreed to pay Pepco each month all amounts due from Pepco to the sellers under those agreements for the immediately preceding month
associated with such capacity, energy, ancillary services and other benefits. The Back-to-Back Agreement, which did not expire until 2021, obligated Mirant to purchase power from Pepco at prices that typically were higher than the market prices for
power. In the bankruptcy proceedings, the Mirant Debtors sought to reject the Back-to-Back Agreement or to recharacterize it as
pre-petition debt, which efforts, if successful, would have resulted in the Mirant Debtors having no further obligation to perform and in Pepco receiving a claim in the bankruptcy proceedings for its resulting damages. Pending a final determination
of the Mirant Debtors ability to reject or recharacterize the Back-to-Back Agreement and certain other agreements with Pepco, the Plan provided that the Mirant Debtors obligations under the APSA and the Back-to-Back Agreement were
interim obligations of Mirant Power Purchase and were unconditionally guaranteed by Mirant. On May 30, 2006, Mirant and
various of its subsidiaries (collectively the Mirant Settling Parties) entered into the Settlement Agreement with the Pepco Settling Parties. The Settlement Agreement could not become effective until it had been approved by the
Bankruptcy Court and that approval order had become a final order no longer subject to appeal. The Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Settlement Agreement on August 9, 2006. That order was appealed, but the appeal was dismissed by
agreement of the parties in August 2007, and the Settlement Agreement became effective August 10, 2007. The Settlement Agreement fully resolved the contract rejection motions that remained pending in the bankruptcy proceedings, as well as
other matters disputed between Pepco and Mirant and its subsidiaries. Under the Settlement Agreement, Mirant Power Purchase assumed the remaining obligations under the APSA, and Mirant has guaranteed its performance. The Back-to-Back Agreement was
rejected and terminated effective as of May 31, 2006. The Settlement Agreement granted Pepco a claim against Old Mirant in Old
Mirants bankruptcy proceedings that was to result in Pepco receiving common stock of Mirant and cash having a value, after liquidation of the stock by Pepco, equal to $520 million. Shortly after the Settlement Agreement became effective,
Mirant distributed approximately 14 million shares of Mirant common stock from the shares reserved for disputed claims under the Plan to Pepco to satisfy its claim. The Mirant shares in the share reserve, including the shares distributed to
Pepco, have been treated as issued and outstanding since Mirant emerged from bankruptcy. Pepcos liquidation of those shares resulted in net proceeds of approximately $522 million and Pepco paid Mirant the amount in excess of
$520 million. Pepco also refunded to Mirant Power Purchase approximately $36 million Pepco had received under the Back-to-Back Agreement for energy, capacity or other services delivered after May 31, 2006, through the date the
Settlement Agreement became effective. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Courts August 9, 2006, approval order had resulted in Mirant paying Pepco $70 million under the terms of the Settlement Agreement shortly after the appeal was filed.
Pepco repaid the $70 million once the Settlement Agreement became fully effective. Upon the distribution of the shares to Pepco,
Mirant recognized a gain of $379 million. The gain included (1) $341 million representing the fair value of the price risk management liability that was reversed as a result of the rejection of the Back-to-Back Agreement,
(2) $36 million refunded by Pepco for payments made under the Back-to-Back Agreement for periods after May 31, 2006, and (3) $2 million for the excess payment Pepco received from liquidation of the shares that were
distributed to it. The $341 million and $2 million are included in other income, net and the $36 million is included in gross margin in the consolidated statement of operations.  F-61 
Table of ContentsNew York Tax Proceedings Mirant New York, Mirant Bowline, Mirant Lovett and Hudson Valley Gas (collectively with Mirant New York, Mirant Bowline and Mirant Lovett, the New York Companies) were the petitioners in various
proceedings (the Tax Certiorari Proceedings) initially brought in the New York state courts challenging the assessed values determined by local taxing authorities for the Bowline and Lovett generating facilities and a natural gas
pipeline (the HVG Property) owned by Hudson Valley Gas. Mirant Bowline had challenged the assessed value of the Bowline generating facility and the resulting local tax assessments for tax years 1995 through 2006. Mirant Bowline succeeded
to rights held by Orange and Rockland for the tax years prior to its acquisition of the Bowline facility in 1999 under its agreement with Orange and Rockland for the purchase of that facility. Mirant Lovett had challenged the assessed
value of the Lovett facility for each of the years 2000 through 2006. Hudson Valley Gas had challenged the assessed value of the HVG Property for each of the years 2004 through 2006. As of December 31, 2006, Mirant Bowline and Mirant Lovett had
not paid property taxes on the Bowline and Lovett generating facilities that fell due in the period from September 30, 2003, through December 31, 2006, in order to preserve their respective rights to offset the overpayments of taxes made
in earlier years against the sums payable on account of current taxes. Hudson Valley Gas had not paid property taxes that fell due in the period from September 30, 2004, through December 31, 2006. On December 13, 2006, Mirant and the New York Companies entered into a settlement agreement (the Tax Settlement Agreement) with the Town
of Haverstraw (Haverstraw), the Town of Stony Point (Stony Point), the Haverstraw-Stony Point Central School District (the School District), the County of Rockland (the County), the Village of
Haverstraw (Haverstraw Village), and the Village of West Haverstraw (West Haverstraw Village and collectively with Haverstraw, Stony Point, the School District, the County, and Haverstraw Village, the Tax
Jurisdictions). The Tax Settlement Agreement was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on December 14, 2006, and resolved all pending disputes regarding real property taxes between the New York Companies and the Tax Jurisdictions. Under the
agreement, the New York Companies received total refunds of $163 million from the Tax Jurisdictions and paid unpaid but accrued taxes to the Tax Jurisdictions of $115 million, resulting in the New York Companies receiving a net cash payment in the
amount of $48 million. The refunds and unpaid taxes were paid in February 2007. The $163 million of total refunds received by the New York Companies was recognized as a gain in the financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2006. In addition, the
New York Companies had previously accrued a liability based upon the unpaid taxes as billed by the Tax Jurisdictions. Due to the reductions of the unpaid taxes that occurred pursuant to the terms of the Tax Settlement Agreement, the New York
Companies also recognized in the fourth quarter of 2006 a reduction of operating expenses of approximately $23 million related to 2006 and a gain of approximately $71 million related to prior periods. California Settlement The California
Settlement described in Note 18 in California and Western Power MarketsFERC Refund Proceedings Arising Out of California Energy Crisis included a provision that either (1) the partially constructed Contra Costa 8 project, which was
a planned 530 MW combined cycle generating facility, and related equipment (collectively, the CC8 Assets) were to be transferred to PG&E or (2) PG&E would receive additional alternative consideration of $70 million (the
CC8 Alternative Consideration). To fund the CC8 Alternative Consideration, PG&E received an allowed, unsecured claim in the bankruptcy proceedings against Mirant Delta that resulted in a distribution to PG&E of cash and Mirant
common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $70 million. PG&E was required to liquidate the common stock received as part of that distribution and place the net resulting amount plus any cash received into an escrow account.
The California Settlement provided that if the transfer of the CC8 Assets to PG&E did not occur on or before June 30, 2008, then
the CC8 Alternative Consideration was to be paid to PG&E and the Mirant Settling Parties would retain the CC8 Assets. If PG&E closed on its acquisition of the CC8 Assets, the funds in the 
 F-62 
Table of Contents
escrow account were to be paid to Mirant Delta. The transfer of the CC8 Assets to PG&E was completed on November 28, 2006, and the $70 million
escrow account was paid to Mirant Delta. The Company recognized in the fourth quarter of 2006 a gain of $27 million for the amount by which the escrow account exceeded the carrying amount of the CC8 Assets. The gain was included in other income in
the Companys consolidated statements of operations.  F-63
